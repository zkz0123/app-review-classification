"This is a great source of information. I would consider some changes in it:- 1. When the page doesn't exist  then please make it as soon as possible. Also if the page is not there  the app should inform that it is not there. There are many blue links but the page doesn't exist and when it is opened  only buffering circle can be seen there. 2. Please provide all the services of wikimedia  if not able  please provide the most essential in this app itself  like wikitionary  wikiquotes  wikisource  etc. Please provide them as widgets or try any other thing that would let the user use all of the wikimedia services in the same app. 3. Please provide the """"categories"""" pages. I have surfed through many pages where category is written. The page has always opened blank. Please provide the categories pages in the app as you have done it on the browser. 4. I love to read articles and gain knowledge. I liked the concept of reading list but I would appreciate it if you please provide a backup in google drive so that whatever article I have saved under the given caption  they should be saved as it is in google drive under same caption as they are given under the Wikipedia folder in google drive. 5. Please provide reliable links for the books. In some articles  the link goes to that page where either the there is no access or there is no book as promised by the link. 6. Please link google id to the wikipedia so that users don't have to make wikipedia. This would also serve the purpose of google drive backup. 7. This is very important. Many books are not available on wikibooks. Please consider to upload the books that can be uploaded in wikibooks as soon as possible. It is really disappointing that after we open a link and we find either no book or some chapters are missing or some pages are missing. 8. I would highly consider to make the wikipedia search engine better. Please provide wide range of keywords so that the desired article can be accessed. These are some generous suggestions to the wikipedia team. I would be extremely happy to know that you would have considered my suggestions. If you have a better option to make available these services  then please do it. The efforts that you have made to available the world's knowledge at doorstep is highly appreciating. I just wanted to make it a little better.",1,0,0,1,108375
"This is probably the most enjoyable game I've played on Android. It is not without its flaws though. It's still under development. It has been for years and in that time it really hasn't progressed much. There are quests you can't finish and roads you can't take with nothing to signify which ones except they don't work. The """"""""""""""""guardian"""""""""""""""" creatures blocking narrow paths quickly become tedious because they're on nearly every single screen. EVERY cave  no matter how big  eventually narrows multiple times to just big enough for two rats or bees or zombies to stand  unmoving  side by side so you have to fight both at once. It gets real old  real quick. Some rewards for boss fights are really  really bad  useless items. Drop rates for the rarest items are ridiculously low at .1% and even .01%. Respawn rates are completely random  meaning a creature blocking a path may respawn right in front of you before you can even move forward after killing it  sometimes more than once. And the story line is severely lacking for a game with so many years of development. In many quests you are forced to choose sides with zero information and the choice you make permanently effects trade and services available. If you're lucky you get some information AFTER you've chosen a side  but even then it's he said  she said every single time with no real explanation. It's all about the reward. You're choosing a side  not to further an exciting story  but as a cheap device to decide which reward you get  which people you can trade with or which services are available. Repeatedly. There is no thinking involved  no weighing of options. You either choose randomly or you look it up to see what you'll get. Horrible quest design. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen. A TON of quests in the really crappy areas you hate going through are """"""""""""""""back and forth"""""""""""""""" busy work. But somehow it's still really entertaining  at least for a week or two.""""",0,0,1,1,3500

"This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read  write and relax  but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing. This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example  instead all we get is the """"""""""""""""discover"""""""""""""""" feature which only promotes bland  vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories  or video game strategies  or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive  to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is  otherwise you have to look it up manually. There are no set categories or tags  instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post  which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers. People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted  discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want. You can't dislike posts or comments  so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways  while WordPress does not. The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear. All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community  and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.""""",1,0,1,1,85647
Devs  this is an awesome app. I've always been a console guy  and this app with a Bluetooth keyboard is  quite simply  THE BOMB. I do have one wish  though. One of the first things I do when I install a new system is swap the capslock and ctrl keys. A lot of the things I do involve control keystrokes  and it's just so much easier to slide my left pinky over and use the capslock key. I haven't figured out how to do that with Termux yet - if you could clue me in to how I might do that  or consider that sort of keyboard remapping as a future feature  I'd be very appreciative. I've literally found no other flaw with Termux - thanks so much for a true killer app. Update: I installed External Keyboard Helper Pro and it lets me do that remapping. I'd still prefer an internal option  since Termux is the only app I need the remapping in  but at least it gets me there. Update 2: Well  I take back that last. External Keyboard Helper Pro seems to work *sometimes*. But it DOES NOT seem to work within Termux. When I'm in my browser  for example  the capslock key works for ctrl-L to get me up to the address bar. But it doesn't work for ctrl-A D to detach from a screen session in Termux. :-( So  devs - can you find us a way to do this remapping within Termux? UPDATE 3: Ok  I did get it to work with External Keyboard Helper Pro  but to do so I had to use a custom mapping on all of the letter keys to tell them to ignore CapsLock. The CapsLock key does seem to function as ctrl  but it was ALSO doing its CapsLock function - so by programming the letter keys to ignore that all seems well. Whew...,1,0,0,0,66698
This is simply fantastic! GNU/Linux CLI in the palm of your hand --with the apt package-manager to boot! (It's a custom repo  but it has a pretty good selection  nonetheless. (The only thing I'm really missing is PDFGREP  and I bet there's a simple way to get it that I am overlooking.)) Oh  and my phone is NOT ROOTED  by the way  and that hasn't kept from me from doing anything yet. You can get Termux-API to add a few more features  like the ability to send and read SMS messages from the command line. You can also import your contacts  and more neat stuff. You get access to your SD card (after enter a short command one time). I was using (or attempting to use) one of the other most popular terminal emulators  but it was less than bare-bones - with no package manager... Needless to say  I was thrilled to discover this one. The controls are easy to adapt to within a day or two. (Volume up or down gives you your CTRL and/or ALT action.) I love running my scripts on my phone  and you just use [ termux-fix-shebang ] to make it executable in the app. (The directory path in Termux is a little longer than just /bin/bash .) I've even got $(apt list) and $(apt show) piping into dialog then into $(apt install) for a quasi-GUI type package manager setup deal. (It's dirty  but it gives me a selection box with descriptions.) Anyways  I could ramble on and on... I tried quite a few other options to have GNU/Linux in my Samsung Galaxy 6  but nothing compares to this. So  get this app if you love BASH! (or dash or zsh or fish ...-- with aptitude installed  you get choices!!!),1,0,0,1,66756
I got this app to figure out what was running in the background as far as data. Did not know what I got till I played with it. All in one monitor app. Obviously an app can't do everything  but this will point you in the right direction. Found the Samsung browser on my s5 was what was wrong with my data. A preinstalled app. So I switched to chrome. After watching it  chrome stays in region. Samng browser was connecting all over. Dublin  Georgia Maine Washington. This app showed me the light if it. Thank you for this app showing me what was really going on with MY damn data. Android sucks. But this makes it better running stock roms. Back to say I am still impressed. I know exactly what my data is doing by IP address. Like I said still finding messed up apps. Disabled stock ones. I don't want to root again.. so with this I can find the apps running and connecting and disable them threw my app manager. This is strictly a window into what your phone is doing. Also quick look ups on IP addresses used by your connections. Update 4/23/17 I can't say enough about this app. Was about to root my phone to get rid of all the junk apps. Well didn't need to because of this app right here showing me what was connecting in the background and what was running my phone dead everyday. It doesn't tell you this. You have to use the app. Look at your connection and running apps. I had apps running I never used. Restricted the background data and Bam. Phone flies again. Between this and old ass s5  makes these new phones look slow. Thank you again guys & gals.,0,0,0,1,66095
"As good as Subsonic will allow. Very nice software. But the Subsonic server (not DSub) has a few issues concerning browsing large collections: You can list 1) albums alphabetically; 2) Genres; or 3) browse the library as file structure (typically Artist\Album) or tags (Artist\Album). But  Subsonic has no handling of multiple artists or multiple genres on one album  even creating problems since semicolon """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""";"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is simply omitted in artists  leading to strange artists like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""BachMozart"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as opposed to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bach; Mozart""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  or one entry """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bach"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and another """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Mozart"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for same album. Can be mitigated somewhat by the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Browse by tags"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" server setting  resulting in an artist called """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bach/Mozart"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Likewise the genre listing suffers when the genre filed has many entries  since each combination of many genres is understood as one new unique genre  e.g. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Jazz; Bob"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is not the same as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bob; Jazz""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  nor """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Jazz""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  nor """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bob"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Many other databases like MediaMonkey  iTunes handles all this excellently  but not Subsonic. Conclusion is that DSub  though as excellent as it gets  is limited when navigate among your 100.000 albums/tracks. DSub still gets 5 stars. But Subsonic  please do fix this.""""",0,1,1,1,173250
I've loved this app. It has been my replacement for quickpic. But with the recent update hid ALL the files in my sd card. I was just trying to hide few folders. Idk what to do. UPDATE AFTER THE DEV'S REPLY: still nothing. It doesn't show any of my files on music apps or the stock gallery. Only in the file explorer. The way this mess started was by me selecting multiple folders and trying to exclude them  as it didn't work  i tried to hide them. Suddenly it gave me several ''unknown error'' bubbles and as i reopened it  it only showed the internal memory files. Nothing on my sd card is visible. I have very vital files in it  so i need a solution. Please. I think it's necessary for me to mention that i uninstalled and reinstalled the app  i also deleted several nomedia files in hopes it would fix my problem  but it didnt. Now that i reinstalled it  if i use the ''temporarily show hidden files1' option it does show me my pictures. But it does not restore my media in general. I cannot listen to my music or audio files in any player  only directly from the file explorers. Finally  i tried what you said in your reply  but the problem is the apo hid files i didn't even hide  so it doesn't even show me an ''unhide'' option for most of them. Please i expect a quick reply. Thanks in advance. Second update:files are finally appearing after trying twice more. Will this be a permanent solution? Can i safely exclude fiolders withtout my files being hidden by .nomedia files again?,1,1,1,1,65505

"Should read battery_current_now  not battery_current I seem to be on a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""quest"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to find any app/widget/piece of software that will do one simple task: read the battery current sensor in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""relative real-time"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - that is  as the CPU scales up and down  GPU kicks in and out  4G modem does its dance  and as all the little things of the system do their work  I can see the immediate response in the current that is MEASURED BY MY PHONE'S SENSOR.

Best app on my phone.. Including phone itself. After trying 7-10 other e-book readers and finding multiple issues with each one  I stumbled across this one (thinking it looked so basic it was gonna be another crappy one) with nothing to lose...6 years and 7 phones later it remains my all time favorite  and most used app ever. I use it by far more often than any other app  including the phone dialer. Every new phone I've gotten this has always been the first app to go on  and flawless syncing with FB reader and Google drive means I just have to download and sign in on new phone and everything is right in the world again.. plus I can pick up any of my multiple devices and open to same spot no matter what device I stopped on.. Can't go on enough about how much i love this reader.. bought the premium version not because the free one was lacking.. Honestly if I never even open the premium version and kept using the free one it will be worth the price after the years of enjoyment from free one.. Really just buying it to thank developers. Couple of small changes might make it PERFECT (really I'm nit picking here) 1. Auto scroll would be awesome for people like me who need larger font so we don't need to turn page every 3 servings 2. Pinch to adjust font size (for same reason) 3. Bookmarking could be made easier with dedicated space in corner... And that's all I can think of that isn't perfect,1,1,0,1,287868
Something is seriously wrong with the setup process... Pass code initially recv'd was unable to enter as either the app or my cell auto skipped by that screen thus invalidating that code... Unable to find an answer in the FAQS messaged support asking if it would effect the functionality... Response did not answer my question and from what I can tell one can't simply enter a new pass code anywhere once installed.. Therefore uninstall  cleared cache and reinstalled.. The new code support sent obviously no longer worked and a new one was never recv'd... Another problem as when you click the pass code not received another one is sent but kicked out of the pass code screen no water to get back to it... A message in the app has a link to click if pass code not received and a timer pops up saying a rep w call you back... Clicked 2x's and no return call after waiting much longer than the less than 2 min displayed... Deleted as this is simply annoying... Had their support answered my question correctly to begin with don't think I'd be as irked wasting my time or called as didn't ask for a call back so don't add a msg saying someone will when they don't... also annoying... Work in IT and completely understand issues happen either w the app even possibly my error yet not much patience when misinformation... Delete...,0,1,0,0,151309
"When trying the Android app (with offline map pack for the UK) today when using the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature I encountered two bugs which make using the app an incredibly frustrating experience: * When in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode the app does not keep the screen awake so after the phones """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""period of inactivity"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is reached the screen is switched off. This is incredibly frustrating as I had my phone in a case and I had to take it out of the case to switch the screen back on. * When in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode and using the offline maps if you switch out of the app (i.e. using the task switch button in Android) and back into the app the maps completely disappear  the route is still visible (i.e. the lines) but everything else is gone. The only way I've found to fix this is to stop """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and start it all over again! I found this issue due to the previously mentioned issue where the screen would turn off. When I switched the screen back on and went back into the app the maps were gone. I would appreciate if the developer(s) of the app could fix this as the bugs mentioned above make navigation using """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" a real painful experience.""""",1,1,1,0,165096
"Just what I was looking for to track family games This app was perfect for my needs. Needed something that I could easily keep score in various games and customize the values so that it was quick and easy to use and get rid of paper & pen. This app did that  and it had what it needed to do it well. Things like keeping the screen on  and also being smart enough that if I hit +500 +100 +100 that I was saying +700 for that person for a turn. Works perfectly. Now my only 3 things I would love to see to make this app even better. 1.) When exporting to PDF find a way to export all that same information that you can see in the game history like in the app. Then you can make nice tables/graphs in excel with the data and see the nice time/score layouts. 2.) The 4 on screen buttons are by far the most important for me playing games with high point values. I was able to work with just 4 but it would be nice if you could customize to add a few more if desired. 3.) I have not made a mistake YET but I know I will especially with drinking games. If I hit +500 points to somebody and meant to hit +100 I wish there was either an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""undo"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button or there was a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""inverse"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button.

"Best TTS so far! I've been using this the day I got my new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and it has tremendously helped with my language learning instead of reading it all the time! :3 Though I do like it paired with Read Aloud  another awesome tool I have for selecting text and listening to my selection in my target learning language  I do have a few minor issues. For some odd reason  the Notify and Read Aloud apps do not automatically detect the languages I select in Read Aloud and only goes with a default language I set. This means I have to manually set the language I want read  which is very annoying. In addition  the language detection percentage found in Read Aloud does not work at all in my heavy testing. One other problem I have is the headset I plug in my phone used to read the audio stream I set to read aloud doesn't seem to work anymore.

"Does what it claims; and that's the best that can be said. I don't have the time it would take to describe all the ways this app is disappointing.

"Hi. First of all let me thank you for the continued support of the Alarm Klock application. I've been happily using it for many years. However  I'm very unhappy about the new UI. Everything is more complicated now. Consider changing the time of the alarm (which is something I do often): previously you clicked the alarm and you could start changing the time. Now you have to long-click the alarm  then click the time  an only then you can change it. Why make it more complicated? What's the purpose? Other problems: - maximum volume-increase interval is now 60 seconds. In the old app I used 90 seconds and I was happy about it. Why did this had to be disabled? What's so wrong about 90 seconds? - the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""increase/decrease by 1 minute"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" buttons are missing. You now have to fiddle with the system keyboard to achieve this. Inconvenient. - icons are used instead of texts.

PD Is amazing... But just one small complaint I've been playing Pixel Dungeon give or take about 4 years  and I loved it from the beginning. There was a point where I had a hard time keeping up with the game because of all of the updates that was over a year ago so I'm going to try it again. It has been a source of inspiration in my D&D play  and it has never ceased to keep me entertained  no matter how hard or easy I may find it. I especially enjoy a game that is well built  evenly balanced  and takes up less than 30 megabytes of information as if to say; I've been thinking about your Hardware  and I appreciate your patronage. The only time I've had a problem with this game glitching up was due to my own Hardware  completely irrelevant to this game. Except for every so often  I'll touch one part of the screen and my character will want to go the long way  or something out of the way of where I was attempting to go. I don't know if that's a hardware or software problem  but I've encountered it on multiple devices. Regardless this game is fun to play in my opinion. And for those of you with Android consider yourself lucky because you have to pay for it on Steam Powered and iOS all things considered I still think it's worth it!,0,1,0,1,42686

This app is so good it makes too much sense for it to be a stock android app. That would make things too easy. I am a die hard Android fan  but we all know Android tends to make things as multistep as possible in order to avoid user frustration and increase security. I opened this app  did exactly one search and after the app immediately opened since I apparently only had one that started with swiftly  I immediately came here to rate this app. One of the problems I have with next launcher is that the search function requires you to click inside the searchbox  which is at the very top of the screen  making this an inconvenient and inefficient task on my note 5. This app already has the cursor ready to go so you can just type. I immediately knew this is one of the best apps I have ever installed and I have purchased and downloaded many good apps. This app makes it less exhausting to have an android phone. I would die before owning an iphone  but since I like having a clean homescreen and I like to be able to access any app from any screen  I am regularly using shortcut and gesture apps  which is a lot to remember in itself  so having an app that just cuts out two steps improves the entire user experience of my phone.,0,1,1,1,43344

It might have been a fluke. ---------- Installed this app because the amount of storage left on my phone has been low and I wanted to see what apps/files were taking up the most space and move them over to my SD card.

Constantly up to date and always ahead of every other IM  sometimes also ahead with features not present even in some other applications like (video players  image editing  cloud storage and media management). I really like it. I admire their product life cycle and their releases which are very often and fast  Telegram must have good scrum masters  developers and management for sure :D I would like to see more attention involved in the Cloud Storage management  because it is very easy in the current version to delete accidentally a chat and therefore lose all your cloud storage with that chat. Maybe we can have a lock with pin/password/email confermation to delete a chat which we mark as 'important' and on the other hand to delete 'unimportant' chat could be without asking for password/pin/email confermation. I would also like to see a better organization of chats  groups  channels  so for example  when you have 4-5 private group where you are collecting info and stuff about 4-5 cities (1 city for each group)  then you want to have those groups grouped together in a 'master group' called for examples 'Cities for holiday'... and some other improvements are needed :) Good job!!!!!!!!,1,0,0,1,139481
Mixed feelings I've played this game for a long time; i have partecipated in the online community. I enjoyed Andor's Trail  but i have some issues with it. some pretty BIG issues. First  this (very nice  very well written RPG) requires you to grind .. a lot. And to be honest  that's not entirely bad - it's a mobile-phone RPG  so the grinding actually comes useful at times  when you have a moment of boredom during your day  waiting for the bus  at lunch  or whatever  just open it  grind a few mobs  and put it back in your pocket. But you will need to grind quite a lot to advance in the story. Second  while the game is very nice ... it's not finished. NOWHERE near finished. It will never be. There's not been a single update in a whole year and there was ONE update in the year before that. I've basically been playing it since early 2011 and i've seen a two updates  one very minor  since. And that's a real shame  since the story and writing are so good. But after playing it basically every day for two years straight i just couldn't take it anymore and deleted it. Android is just not a good platform to build a full bodied RPG. Sorry guys  but honestly i can't be asked to wait forever.,1,1,0,1,3325
Is a pity this app is neglected (no blame for dev  whose situation & priorties I can't know) but FCs and stability issues now mar a brilliant concept. Vim is actually a great fit for Android: complete navigation and selection control by word/line/block with just the standard keyboard (no wasted screenspace) & split (particularly diffsplit) are killer features that no other editors come close to. Being able to open additional files without exiting app or fiddling w/ menus is also a big plus (hadn't realized how much using slide out menus or the recent apps menu disrupted my process until now). FCs and associated risk of data loss relegate this to being essentially a demo. Still can't bring myself to uninstall though because I WANT it to work so badly. There are a few other issues: word-based input waits for autocorrect to finish before vim gets any input - so many commands are unworkable & you must watch keyboard's prediction row to see what you've typed. Editing .vimrc and other setup involving home directory was also a bit fiddly (though  if I could figure it out it can't be that bad). Overall Vim on Android is hard to argue with  hopefully updates remedy the outstanding issues.,1,1,0,1,36541
"I think a lot of reviewers have missed the point of this app. If all you want to do is send a regular SMS though your phone's provider then this probably isn't the app for you. It is most powerful when coupled with WebSMS  allowing me to automatically send messages for certain number prefixes through a cheaper web-based provider. My first complaint is that it could look a little prettier. It's not as ugly as WebSMS but a little padding around the text could make all the difference. Perhaps the developer wanted to fit as much text on the screen as possible but screens are relatively large and high resolution these days. The """"""""""""""""Black"""""""""""""""" theme is also more like grey under the Material Glass theme for some reason. With those two issues fixed  it would look much like the stock Messaging app. My next complaint is that starting a new thread fires up the WebSMS interface instead of allowing you to type into SMSdroid directly. This inconsistency is a little jarring and there seems little reason for it. I guess SMSdroid is simply lacking a recipient selector. My last complaint is a minor one. The multi-select button doesn't actually do anything. All in all  a thumbs up from me.""""",1,1,1,1,50192
Almost 5 stars This is a great app  especially considering the fact it's emulating the Dreamcast and fairly new. There are 2 things that stop me from giving it that extra star  and it's only because I'm spoilt from ePSxe. 1. Exiting the app via the Home button quits the game without warning. Every once in awhile I'll accidentally hit it (or hit it on purpose  forgetting it doesn't work the same way ePSxe does)  losing a ton of progress. (In case anyone doesn't know how ePSxe works  it remembers the state the game was in after you leave the app  allowing you to restore the game the next time you come back.) 2. Save states. This is mainly only a problem because of the first one. With ePSxe I had 3 options if I wanted to take a break or do something else quickly on my phone. Find a save point (not as easy in most games)  save states or close the game and restore it later  keeping my progress. With Reicast my only option is to find a save point  which are scarce. Unlike the actual consoles these emulators emulate  there's usually countless times you have to urgently close the app due to phone calls or text messages. It's still a really great app and definitely worth getting  though.,0,1,1,1,5473

A very useful app for stamping location information on to photographs. This could be immensely helpful for anyone involved in any sort of field work. It would be good to have some alternatives to the default positioning of the stamp in the bottom right of the image. Using the phone's microphone to trigger the taking of photos is also useful for field work. I found that the saying 'cheese' option worked well but the 'loud sound' trigger didn't (even at high sensitivity). That's a pity because I would rather use some other sound trigger than 'cheese'  e.g. a whistle. Again  from a field work perspective  it would be good to be able to record a brief linked voice annotation/note with each picture because that would provide an efficient way of adding additional context information to the picture. That would be much better than a simple text annotation which would quickly become a pain if taking multiple pictures on a field trip. Adding voice annotation  however  would require the willingness of the developer to extend the app a bit more in the location awareness arena  e.g. storing location waypoints and linked media (photo  audio  text) in  say  GPX format for use in other apps.,1,0,0,1,169036
This app would be amazing if it works properly. I tested it a lot in last two weeks and haven't got proper results.There are some problems or uncertaintes which should be solved: 1) motion trigger don't behave independent of regular snapshot interval. When I set motion trigger it still takes snapshots in regular intervals (refresh time)! The motion events inside the refresh time(with base of last motion event) are ignored! - I think that the refresh time for regular intervals and motion trigger parameters should be split and don't interact. Otherwise the behaviour is rather inpredictable. 2) motion triggers are not precise  the reaction is sometimes delayed or in interaction with other parameters  it is very uncertain. 3) trigger burst (at least for motion event) doesn't work at all. It always takes 1 picture. 4) when I set SD card directory which is not writable  application next time hangs or doesn't work properly  without any warning.The configuration in whole is not error safe  the input values are not checked for validity. Anyway I hope that this my investigation will help improve this app...as it wasn't updated for 1 and half year. And I'd pay for it if it gets solved.,1,1,0,0,8552
Mostly useful for techy types. Great monitoring tool  but I didn't notice that it increased my WiFi reception  or stabilize my connection. Even on a large phone (LG Spectrum II)  I found the text output of the monitoring screen difficult to read. The app reminiscent of the old PC OS tools that reported everything the OS was doing. If the developer would use a more graphic oriented interface  it would be more useful to lay users. Other users complained that WiFi Fixer was a battery hog  however  I found using the settings to stop monitoring of services kept WiFi fixer from zapping battery life. However  this effectively reduces WiFi Fixer's usefulness. The developer should update the interface to specify which category of services to disable. For instance  disable monitoring screen handlers  app managers  but continue to monitor network activity. I found this app less than useful  but safe for my phone. The developer should consider updating the UI to a GUI  and add selective monitoring  and packet buffering to help stabilize connectivity  and well as a warning when the phone is switching from WiFi to carrier data  or when the WiFi signal is too low to maintain a connection.,1,0,0,1,69120
Overall  Sky Map is a great application. It is perfect for the beginner astronomer  as well as those looking to learn more about astronomy  and familiarize themselves with the solar system. It includes many convenient features such as the ability to enable and disable the appearance of stars  constellations  planets  and much more. The feature I enjoyed the most was the ability to ‚Äútime travel.‚Äù I could easily enter a date and time  (past or future)  and view the solar system at that moment. This feature also allowed me to observe the changes in space that had occurred  or that would occur between the present and the time selected. Sky Map was able to accurately determine my location  and display celestial objects in relation to my position. An element that should be incorporated into this app is the ability for users to view information about any given celestial object they select. This would provide a more educational experience for those interested in furthering their knowledge about celestial objects  rather than just where they are located. In conclusion  this is an easy to operate  yet highly capable app that many astronomers  both new and experienced will enjoy.,1,0,1,1,167729

"Awesome! Pros: I have been looking for an app like this ever since I rooted my Gallaxy S2 back in the day and installed Cyanogenmod losing the voice notifications the Samsung built in! I ditched it in favor of a Nexus 5 when it launched. This app works really well and I love all the options! It is heading in a great direction! It is ready for daily use! Cons: As many other reviewers have pointed out the privacy concerns of having your messages read aloud is a bit of a problem. I hope that is addressed in future updates. I like that you can have it announce the app name only but in some cases I would like to know the senders name to know if it is worth my time to open. Possible Improvements: Having a feature that would read only """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""x"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" amount of characters of the message could cover the privacy issue until it is possible to identify senders. It would also be nice to see varying permission for each app  for instance %t + %m / %t / %m. Also  and this is a little nit picky  it would be nice if it would announce """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""New email"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" instead of just """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Email"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for all messaging/email/chat style apps.""""",1,1,0,1,361
"Compared with the Sword Project app on iOS (PocketSword)  I was very pleased to discover that this """"And Bible"""" app also supports: * multiple synchronized windows * verse comparisons for multiple translations * off-line text-to-speech audio. Some enhancements found in the iOS PocketSword app that I would also like to see here: 1. Display commentary for an entire chapter (just like an entire Bible chapter is displayed)  and not just commentary for one verse. 2. Immediately display the footnote info when I tap on the highlighted footnote letter (just like a Strong's number definition is immediately displayed) instead of requiring me to first select the verse and then choose from the context menu """"Footnotes and references"""". 3. Show results from my previous 'find' so that I can easily visit each search result and not have to repeat the search. 4. Add the ability to download new modules from user-defined locations. I already have many text & commentary modules shared from a non-public server  and it was awkward to have to manually copy them onto the Android device. But even without these requested enhancements  I'm happy to have a Sword Project compatible app on Android!",1,0,0,1,282986
"Even though I tried this with different keyboards it's editing capabilies are poor. They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet. Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled. One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or  for example  undo deletions. rather than sweat coding more editor functions  simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible. There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic. being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one. Again  this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch. Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side. I realize there is a screen real estate issue  especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone  but perhaps that's a case of """"""""""""""""you shouldn't be doing that"""""""""""""""".

I have been getting more knowledgeable and skilled at MH4U  and I consider this app a godsend; such a handy wealth of information right in my hands  all offilne to boot :) This app is a must have for any hunter  especially newcomers. However  there ARE a few problems that prevent this app from truly being great: 1. Optimization - The app works fine on my main phone  a Samsung Galaxy S5  but on my backup phone which is an Alcatel model  some features don't work. Namely the Armor Set Builder; that just doesn't work at all. 2. There are no 3D renders of armor pieces or weapons; I think that would be a cool addition. 3. While I see items needed to craft Palico DLC outfits & weapons  it isn't stated in the app. There's also no mention of normal Palico outfits/weapons either. Showing this info would come in pretty handy. 4. It would be EXTREMELY useful to showcase quest trees; that is  prerequisites to a specific quest. 5. There's little to no mention of G rank quests. 6. Some information is missing  primarily related to the uses/descriptions of some items. 7. Fatalis has no materials data; everything says 0%. If those things could be addressed  then that would be 5 stars!,1,1,1,1,40679
"What happened to the full editor??!!! Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird  useless version of what it was before.

"I have used this app for years  but some of the changes you have made recently just don't make sense. JuiceSSH works much better. I use Dyndns with pinhole ports through my router  my home Linux systems can be accessed either on a 192.168.1.x IP address on my home network or using an uncommon port on the Internet IP address of the router using PNAT to the correct SSH server. In my Connectbot  each server has two entries  one with its internal IP and the other with its Dyndns address. The icon functionality used to make some sense but now it does not. If you accessed a server successfully once before  it used to give a green tick by the server name  not it's a red exclamation mark. If a server hasn't been accessed for two days  it didn't used to matter on previous versions  the green tick would be there to show the last access worked. Now you get a """"No Entry"""" sign  which makes no sense. I also have a problem on my old Nexus 7 tablet on Android 4.3 where when I try to import keys that are in the internal storage  it goes straight to Amazon Drive to try to find the keys with no option to go back to the find them on the local device. It seems to be a backwards step.",0,1,0,0,18025
For years  this was the best Android mail app available. It's unbelievable how the current developers have ruined such a fantastic email utility. Many of the old behaviors have been modified to work in unintuitive ways  demonstrating a lack of basic user ergonomics. The Unified Inbox in particular is a catastrophe. Now  unread messages show before read messages regardless of date or time. Read messages do not show at all (they completely disappear from Unified Inbox) UNLESS YOU READ THEM WITH ANOTHER CLIENT (such as your desktop PC). If you read a message with another client  it will appear below the list of unread messages  completely out of time/date order. The Unified Inbox worked perfectly in older versions  but whoever has been modifying the code for this section of K-9 is essentially incompetent. There should be settings to configure the Unified Inbox behavior back to the old method if a user prefers that. It is after all the reason most of us switched to K9 in the first place. But the current behavior of showing messages read on another client in one way  and messages read in K-9 in another way  is just extremely poor development  and it needs to be fixed.,1,0,1,1,279291
Easily the best 100 bucks you will never spend. Even an old beat to heck psp can set you back a pretty penny and that is without the games  even then there is the fact that one is the size of a small brick. So why bother with all that when you can get it for free with better visuals and audio? Simple you would need a monumental hole in your head. This has taken almost everything that I have tossed its way and done very well. All at full fps and with some really good graphics. However it is not perfect. Things to know  if you are a fan of Armored Core like me  Last Raven doesn't really work. If that were working I would drop a dozen stars. Also some other games do not always work smoothly  but hey  it's free right. You will need a powerful phone however. Emulators by nature are power  memory and hard-drive hogs. This is no exeption. Minimum is a Samsung Galaxy S 5 with at least 32 gigs of space. Best bet  Moto Droidz or anything really powerful. IPhones and windows phones are not recommended due to their locking of software. Jailbreaking in can void your warenty. That said  exellent work. And give gold a shot  these guys can use all of the support they can get.,0,0,1,1,56531
"Very good - and could be better; 4 3/4 stars. This does exactly what it's supposed to do - tells you where you are  where you're going  approximate altitude and all the other good stuff. I've used it in light aircraft and as a passenger on commercial jet flights and it works wonderfully. A couple of things could be better: *** Storage - Avare downloads and stores a lot of map data  and getting an Android phone to store that on the SD card rather than the phone's memory is a chore. I've done this on four devices and it's been manual every time. Create a directory on the SD card  then point Avare to store maps there. Then curse when it doesn't work the first time. With maps.me doing it at the push of a button  I'd wholeheartedly advocate this as an upgrade. Heck  I'd PAY for it - if it saved me an hour's fussing it'd be worth every penny. Just sayin' ****Flight planning. Not as intuitive as you might imagine - again it takes fussing. Since I most often use the app as a reference (""""""""""""""""where the heck am I"""""""""""""""") rather than as a guidance method  this isn't such a problem for me but I've heard complaints about it.

A decent free Subsonic app...but UltraSonic is still somewhat better For free  I cannot complain. I wanted an app to connect to my Ampache server via HTTPS and this worked. Bandwidth limitation to help save some data usage on mobile is a huge plus! It has a much better interface than then any other free Subsonic apps  and above and beyond any native Ampache apps (mostly all dead anyway). Still  it is not without its limitations. The audio focus is way off. Not only does it mute the music when navigation kicks in  but it mutes the navigation audio as well. Kind of useless at this point. Gapless playback is not available (the first attempt to play streaming ogg files will just stop and skip to the next song after 20 seconds; would have to skip back to play correctly...just got annoying after a while). It's a good app for those that don't really expect or need too much. But  it lacks quite a bit that Ultrasonic (also free...but dead project) does better (list by album title  gapless playback  correct audio focus  and being able to list my video catalog and play them). Since the Ultrasonic project looks like it's dead  I'm really hoping this one will catch up.,0,0,0,1,16461
Though infrequently updated - and going to check his website and toss him a few dollars if he accepts. For FREE(!) this app is beyond all expectations. I have over 1300 books in it. the ability to sync to good reads (at least receive from  believe send to is broken)  cross reference with library things  keep track of loans to people  and backup reminders (and the backups work!) are an amazing value. Let me explain the basic process. 1.) Download this app and good reads app 2.) link to goodreads and librarythings 3.) Open good reads and use their UPC scanner to scan in everything you own indiscriminately. Try to organize on teh good reads side if you feel inclined. 4.) Sync from good reads (one way  if send is still broken) - all books  their covers  synopsis  page count - all data is now in book catalogue. You can search by auther  borrowed  and more. Saves me from re-buying books - since 1300 is a little hard to keep track of. Furthermore  unlike the good reads app - this works offline. I can also give a copy to friends if they want to borrow they have a copy of my database. My favorite android app - yes  synergy between others  but the developer did it!,0,0,0,1,158607
Buffering issues are ruining my afternoon commute. I'm an NPR fan and in particular a Morning Edition and All Things Considered junkie. I can get my fix of Morning Edition with my local affiliate station but on the way home I depend on the NPR News app. However  the failure of the audio segments to properly buffer means that the first minute (or five) of each individual story is nothing but choppy bits of sound and long pauses. I wind up missing most of the context and spend the entire story trying to figure out what it is actually about. If the people behind the app are having trouble getting their buffering settings right then at least give us the option to download the audio files in their entirety. I've got more than enough storage (50GB). Add a setting that will either allow or disable audio downloads over cell networks (WiFi only) and you've got people's cellular data concerns covered too. Delete the files when the playlist is cleared and you're good to go. I'd be happy to spend a good minute or two before leaving work downloading all the files for ATC so I can have a more pleasant and informative drive home.

Motorola Defy +  Android 2.3. Works as advertised. Sky view follows phone screen orientation accurately  both in azimut and in elevation. 4 stars only due to comparison with SkEye  as I haven't found how Sky Map can show basic details for the celestial body at the screen center and how Sky Map can show celestial position of the screen center (SkEye can show this information). Allows to search a specific celestial body (but you need to remember the name as you have to type it; I could not find a list of celestial bodies  list that is available with SkEye) and shows on the screen an arrow allowing to orientate the screen towards the searched body. It is not always clear if the GPS position has locked correctly: it is necessary to use an other application to check that the GPS position is being acquired properly (SkEye shows when starting the GPS status with number of visible and used satellites and informs when a GPS position has been acquired properly). Small foot print (less than 0.5MB) and can be moved to SDCard. No adds that I could see. So far good enough for me although I prefer SkEye for the reasons described previously.

You're fighting on 15 pressing quickly  die and press no to the ahnk. Move the 'no' away from creatures or set a delay please. I enjoy this game  I don't enjoy dying after ninety minutes in a good game. Ideas for additions: Add a 'throb entire screen red when hp is low (and maybe players can set the percent)'  space the buttons so the game can be played on devices with small screens without searching when trying to rest for one enemy's step  fix auto-pathing (it currently paths based on enemies that are not visible and steps back and forth when no path is available)  bugfix the autopathing arrow after a fight (frequently only advances one step or disappears without other actions)  fix the wand of reach (does not switch with enemies as the description states) and a few other things. Keep up the good work on adding things just don't forget the main priority is to have it function well. I am a person who likes to donate yet I do not appreciate improvements when known problems exist  it just compounds the issue and it is the reason software such as Windows exists with great feature bloat and so many bugs the average user is always upset about something.,1,1,0,1,42676
"Yes  it's a rather geeky app and you need to have a telnet client  such as the command line one Windows comes with that you can get in """"Turn Windows features on or off""""  or PuTTY. But once you connect to it  it's very straightforward to use. Just type into the terminal window and your keystrokes appear instantly on the Android device. If you can't figure out telnet  there's another remote keyboard app out there that uses a web interface  but you still need to enter some numbers in a browser to connect. (Or buy a bluetooth keyboard  it's simpler still.) I prefer this one because I like the simplicity of telnet and like the """"send to PC"""" button at the bottom right of the phone screen  to send whatever's in the text box to the PC. It's a great way to get URLs out to a PC (or send a bunch of text up to be processed with a regex and then pasted back to the phone) while you're using Remote Keyboard. Manual ROT-13 encryption is a strange feature to include  but alright I guess. I'd really prefer if there were an option to have real encryption  either with telnet over SSL (if the user can puzzle out how to create such a connection)  or even better  SSH.",1,0,0,1,110653

Needs Work!! Since I use gVim every day at work and home  I was glad to see this for Android  so I installed it. Then my phone kept rebooting. I'm an IT Architect  so I knew what to do. It took me a while -- a couple of weeks  of uninstalling a couple of other apps along with this one (the apps I had installed just before the phone started rebooting)  then re-installing them (over days!) and then uninstalling  and so on. As I say  that took many days  since I would have to wait for a couple of days to see if the phone would reboot or not .I finally was able to conclusively prove that it was only after I installed Vim Touch that the phone kept rebooting. I have now had it uninstalled for a couple of weeks  I've reinstalled the other apps  and my phone is not rebooting. Since it does not run all the time in the background  all I can figure is that there is something that is going haywire during the install itself  causing problems later on. File corruption? Something not being registered right? I haven't done any Android development  just UNIX and Linux (since 1980!)  so I don't know what to tell you.

"Very useful software Its a very useful software  but there is one little suggestion that I have that I think can improve it. If you can make this application detect whether the user is actively using the device or not  and if they are using it  then there isn't any point to send the notification. Because they are seeing the notification themselves on the device. For example if you can make an option in the configuration page of the application  something like: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Send notifications only when the device is locked."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and the application detects that the phone is locked (not in use physically) it should send the notification  otherwise not. That too could be an 'option' of course for those who'd like to opt for it. The reason I am saying this could be useful is because in my Ubuntu setup  I keep a record of all the notifications like android. So all of the notifications that I received when I was away are stacked. Now  when I am away from my computer  I am probably using my phone. So when i come back  at times i have up to 50 or 60 notifications which all of them I have read on the phone. Do you think this is possible?""""",1,0,0,1,29574

Website and App Syncing Needed! The app has evolved and delivers a much better experience than when I first downloaded it. I have been able to listen to NPR program without much hassle and only intermittently experience playback issues or glitches. I think that the app is becoming quite polished and I appreciate your dedication to updating the catalog of audio files by bringing more shows to the app. One improvement that I would like to see is an integration between the website and your apps. Sometimes I find myself browsing NPR and wishing I could continue a story on my mobile device at a later point if I am on the move. The addition of a saved articles or read-it-later type functionality would be awesome. Another key feature would be a unified playlist that syncs between app and our profiles on the website. I like to stream your app in my car and it would be nice to add stories I am interested in from my computer and play them on my mobile device when I get into my car. Currently  there does not appear to be any profile functionality on the mobile app. Keep up the great work. I really enjoy using this app as a source for news and culture.,1,1,0,1,162840

Nice job  guys! ======================================================================================== Update: It seems tasks are laid out according to GMT  rather than local time  on the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Due"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tab (Today  Tomorrow  Next Days  Someday). Due dates display correctly in editing and on the server. This makes it a bit difficult to see what you've entered for Tomorrow  as it appears as Today  etc. There's also some inconsistency when dealing with subtasks. It seems there may be two or more standards for specifying them: one way wherein the subtask is entered as a new line in the Description field  and another using a more formal specification. Otherwise a nice little app. Looking forward to paying a few bucks for it once the kinks are worked out.""""",0,0,0,1,96230
Ok google officially you are crap. Out of the 30% now rate this as one star. Is that a clue to sort this stupid piece of code out. It is not an app as it bears the user no benefit. I have bought an app. It now tells me it wont run unless I update this.. you are holding me to ransome. Why should a purchase need me to use your code??. Your car is needs petrol but still works when you use texaco or bp. It does not stop on the freeway because you use a different petrol provider. SORT IT. Every time there is an update more of MY data not YOURS gets sucked down. Now you want sms messages access to protected areas take our contacts. If the police wanted this data they need a warrant  no google wants this and its rediculous permissions to be accepted. Shame on you google. Bugger me wants to control nfc..... This is supposed to be a piece of software that enables third party apps not a stealth data stealing weasel. Apps that used to work require an update to this ----- why---- because Google insists  not necause the app needs it. It is so you have to have this malware on board.... Come on let it do what it is supposed to do  be an enabler.,1,1,1,0,232358
First and maybe only review. I had a botched update to my phone (sony....worst computer software ever.) Anyway the net result is that I couldn't access the settings on my android phone  I couldn't access the homescreen or the app drawer or basically anything  by some miracle I could just about get to the custom lockscreen I had  and by receiving a text in this crippled state I was able to get to the messages app  which still had all my messages  so I knew the data was there. I tried various programs to get the SMS off the phone onto my computer but none of them worked as it relied on going to the settings which was inaccessible for me :/ By some crazy bodging I managed to get to the wifi setting and turn on my wifi  and also managed to get to the app store to subsequently open this app  finally I connected it to my gmail account and pressed backup....and it did! 2-3 hours after the botched update I'm now sitting looking at my phone slowly tick off all the sms and seeing them appear in my gmail  this beautiful app saved my arse and earned my loyalty  when I have a spare few quid  this dev is getting a donation! Major Kudos o7,1,0,0,0,21492

im not sure there is any real point unless theres a device too stupid to know when a new file was added and automatically count it in the list (sounds like some devices werent thought up carefully but whatever). as for my device anytime a new file is added its automatically counted  which is odd for a piece of garbage device like mine. the external storage is auto-scanned anyway upon mounting so this app seems pointless to me  but it is fun to goof off with so ill give that much. in any case my only problem is that despite specifying the directory (external) it still scans the internal. but it also scans the external as well. now if we can get it to only scan the specified and not the other as well (if the file path is /sdcard0 it should only scan sdcard0  if its sdcard1 to only scan sdcard1 - not both). also we should also be allowed to not put /storage/ or /mnt/ before .... if i want to only put /sdcard0/ it should scan even though /storage/ wasnt added. the reason is because it should already know the /storage/ (or /mnt/) part so we shouldnt have to specify that in the directory. just where its going from there.,1,1,0,1,32100
Very nice app. Could you come up with the on off switch designed by checkbox? By that it wouldn't go off automatically  and stay on until the checkbox is unchecked. You can make it better by showing pending access  access log and data usage. For pending access another third option is needed between access and no access  ask for access type. Challenge is not to increase the size  shall see forward to your updates. Grey shirts would have been perfect if only checkbox was used instead of push button. OK  rating is updated :-) you already have a on off switch  slider type. I'm asking to replace it with checkbox  that little box with a right sign when checked  that takes even less space than slider. And keep in mind other possible improvements. No it's that orange slider switch at the front screen which makes the firewall itself on and off. What else your app does other than blocking the connection? Ya  checkboxes cannot be unchecked automatically without human input. That's way I'm asking to use checkbox instead of slider or push button. Everything else can make it better is already said. Shall check out your updates.,1,0,1,0,96592
"I love this app and  for the most part  can't imagine another that would enable users simpler access to the key features this app offers. Any attempt to make it more sophisticated would DISTRACT (from the main goals for using such a program) and would DETRACT (from its powerful and yet wonderfully simple-to-use functions). Worth mentioning  however  is that  after the program having worked perfectly on my former Galaxy S5 with Lollipop (Android 5)  I switched to an Alcatel Icon 4 with Marshmallow (Android 6) and found that  every time I tried to start using the app  I would respond """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Yes"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to the initial dialogue pop-up asking if I wanted to Download a bible version  yet the program kept then showing an error msg like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""...cannot connect to the Internet.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

"I am completely lost as to why this app gets so many good reviews  because for me  it is AWFUL - at least as far as custom decks are concerned. It is far too over-complicated. Bear witness. Even trying to explain why it is so terrible will be confusing  and then bear in mind  working with the app is even worse. For example  it totally tries to own when and what I can study. It disappears my cards if it thinks I have studied them enough  forcing me to go and figure out how to put them back into the study session based on how many days to advance my """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""review"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" session. If I want to set up a custom study session to force it to allow me to study what I want  when I want  again it disappears the original deck - where I can no longer """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""browse"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" my list of cards  which btw  I have to do whenever I want to see a custom field because the app does not make it easy to add the field to the study deck.

GRATE Start 1st off I waited a few weeks to test it out before doing this write up I found a few problems in the core of the setup of it  when a user dos not send his key ID with the encrypted file it will not do a search for a good key (GPG and PGP do) I do not send Key ID with messages for safety reason and not all pgp messages I send are in stranded E-mail when the key ID is not there it thinks it is a PW protected and dos not check for the keys. (That should be fixed ASAP) I also would like to see a way to do more advanced configurations like you can with most desk top client. Both those things are big deals with me. For that it is only a 3 star. Removed one star for each problem I had. Do not let that make you think this is not a good thing to use though. I still do. I need to know one thing not tested as of now but when certifying keys can you pick the certification of the key? and add notes to the cert? (Both of those things I would like to see too if it is not there) I do use a key policy URL so I would like to use it on the phone app too if possible. Thanks for bringing GPG/pgp to our phones.,1,1,1,1,15848

This is an OK app but it does have two issues. The first one is... it does Not offer automatic rotational viewing. So in other words  on my Samsung phones the content is displayed in portrait mode when my phone is charging in landscape mode. From what I can gather Dashclock uses the display mode that your phone is last on when it activates. So if your Homescreen is able to rotate like on a tablet  then no problem. However  if you're using a phone and your homescreen locks at only portrait mode then when Dashclock starts while you're charging... everything will be displayed sideways. The only way around that would be to open up any app that rotates  like Gmail for instance...then Dashclock will be displayed properly if your phone is in landscape mode. I did that until I found a rotational app that rotates my homescreen only when it's plugged in. The second issue/bug I found is a biggie. When Dashclock is running  it disables the swipe down to show notifications. When I first discovered this bug I thought it was my phone... but the problem only occurs when Dashclock is activated during charge....,0,1,1,1,8255
I have been using Book Catalogue for a long time and I am very impressed. I have tried several Apps for cataloging my books and this App is the only one that has everything I need and much much more. It makes it very easy to keep track of the dates I begin and finish a book  I love the cover photos and also being able to sync with Goodreads. I really like that I am able to search for books with the Author Name and the Name of the book  or a few other options for adding books. There are many options to customize fields so you can see all information desired about a Book  Author  ISBN  Series  Publisher  Reading Dates  Ratings  Notes and more. I also love that I am able to look up a book by the ASIN. I am almost always able to find each book I search for. Keeping track of my Library has never been easier. There is the Name of the Book  It has the Author Name  ISBN  Page count  type of Book(paperback  Hardcover  Audiobook  etc...)Bookshelves  Notes  Reading Dates  Location of the Book  the Description and more. I am very happy to have found such a useful App  I use this App Several times a Day.,0,0,1,1,158579
I used the app to search for names in a directory with 20 text files (from 247KB up to 3927KB). The search uses regular expressions and ignores case. This app can really search for what I need to look for in the document. On my mobile phone (2 Cores 1.2GHz)  the search process takes about 30 seconds  maybe up to 40 seconds to check the result for all the files. The same search process takes about 15 to 20 seconds On a tablet pc (4 Cores 1.3GHz). My default document viewer is having trouble opening these moderately big sized txt files but with aGrep  opening and viewing the text within the search results is amazingly fast. It is also easy to cancel the searching so you can quickly change the search parameters if you made a mistake on your input. (Doing all this search process on a mainstream desktop PC will display the results instantaneously) I don't know if it is about my Phone's processing power that the search result takes some time. From the apps that I have tried out so far  this is the only one that can do the task. Now  I'm just checking if there are other apps that can do it faster.,0,0,1,1,2456
"I have never reviewed an app before today but due to the massive inconvenience this app has caused me I felt it was only fair to warn other's about this update.

I've tried EVERYTHING to fix this  every single method I've found online  I spent an hour and a half on the phone yesterday with my phone carrier's tech support while they tried sending a few updates and fixes remotely to my phone  but nothing worked.

Incredible app .. allows me to run all my essential linux console programs on my tablet or phone  with or without external bluetooth keyboard. Eg: Emacs/tramp editing over VPN; full access/editing of my encrypted org-mode files (synced with dropbox/dropsync); monitoring phone's resources with htop. And  if I'm at someone else's computer and need access to my stuff  I can just ssh into my phone and enjoy the convenience of big screen/keyboard/mouse with my portable server! :-) Yeah  it's slower than a desktop  but surprisingly usable. Before this  I had thought seriously about loading ubuntu onto my tablet to get this type of portable linux environment  but honestly  termux gives me pretty much everything I need (console-based for now)  plus android .. best of both worlds! Just when I'm already blown away  I find other really stuff in the well-written docs: multiple-sessions  keyboard enhancements (such as: press volume down to simulator ctrl)  termux-api (send/read SMS  text-to-speech etc.) ... just incredible.

5 Stars It's better than a 4 so I give it a 5. I just discovered Lucid and gave it a Test Drive on both my phone and a large tablet like HP Slate. I have tested a bunch of different browsers and this is the first one that works out really great on both devices. Some of the web pages load up a little nicer in desktop mode on my HP than it does using my other go to browser(Dolphin). I can get the fonts big enough using Lucid so a legally blind person could read. User interface  customization  ease of use  etc. is all quite to my liking so far. I will probably be a buyer for the ad free version of this browser. I just did an additional comparison to the Dolphin browser I was using for a few weeks... I played back video on Universal Sports.... Lucid browser played the video smooth and flawless while the Dolphin browser was playing back slowly  stalled and crashed once. My impressions are that this is the better browser. Facebook is a little buggy with the Lucid browser- having trouble clicking to chat and new comments in the top menu bar... that would be the only fault I have found so far.,1,1,1,1,119785
Great but has a playback bug that really annoys me I love the features on this player  but there is one bug that annoys the heck out of me. Many times  when I skip to the next track on the playlist  there is no music playing even though the progress bar and time is moving along. The only way to get it playing is to press the pause button and then press play again. This happens in offline mode as well as online mode. It didn't always do this before  so I don't know what happened. I've used this player for well over a year  but this problem just started like a month or two ago. *update*: I did try reinstalling Dsub  but after reinstalling  i found that it remembered all of my settings. I found that the playback problem seems to be related to my bluetooth speaker (UE Boom). When i use dsub w/o the bluetooth speaker  everything seems to behaves normally. Very strange problem. Possibly the player stops sending signals to the speaker in between song skips and it has trouble reinitiating when the next song starts? I can hear slight clicky sounds on the bluetooth speaker when skipping tracks.,1,1,1,1,173432

Google play service has not work. Tried all the trick. Enentually reset. I did &gt;20 times. Still not work. That leaves rooting. I decide not to Dr o. If reset is not working  roting may not help. Cant save n retrieved game. YouTube not working. I download to factory version. That works. Not really  many clips are not supported. The one that supported  the clip keep skipping. Google want us to use play service  so it can collect our data. Fine  the app n YouTube r free. Of course  uber wants us to play. Not going to do it if google refuses. I search internet. The prob start at least 2 yr ago. According one article  despite &gt; 800k ppl complain  google is not going. My advice do not download.

Tell Google what I think  well I'm not a great fan of Android due to incompatibility with this system .updates from any apps can cause problems  meaning an app might work on one device but not on another. You buy an app (but not anymore for me) then it gets an update and it does not work. I had a problem with the wifi icon greyed (wifi still worked even though grey means not connected) out rather than have a blue icon past several months. Googled the problem but not much luck with the solution. I deleted all the updates still no luck then deleted a piece of software called GOOGLE SETTINGS connected to GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES which was a previous update. By doing this it brought back the familier blue wifi icon to let you know you are connected. Unfortunately the latest update of Gmail crashes too on android so have rolled back to the factory version. I've been a great fan of Google for decades since they came on the scene  but Android versions does not cut it for me PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES. Sorry to say if I can give no stars I would  so my score for this software 0/5.,0,1,1,1,240833
"5Stars and highest donation 1) I don't only contact developers when having a problem or a request with an application  I also do so when being seriously impressed  which are the case with your """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""ClipStack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" application. This was obvious for acknowledgement after only 5 mins for my part. 2) You offer all functions in the free version  3) You ask for donation  but only to support you  not to unlock extra features  as they are already available in the free version. 4) The application does NOT take a lot of memory = it's a small size.  5) Simply  you have made a very nice looking interface and very easy to access from the drop-down menu at the top of screen. THANK YOU. In my head it yields: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Make it work  but keep it simple""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  which is exactly what you did.  I find these reasons to be VERY high and humble service. Hence I donated the highest possible amount you've made available. Respect for you """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""guys"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". I will of course rate you on Google play store.  Yasemin Nielsen  Denmark/Norway""""",1,1,1,1,99952
Very impressive browser and I love the ad blocker. At first I thought it wasn't working after I turned it on and then I realized I needed to restart the browser. When I did - ads were blocked. Everything works much faster with the ad blocker on - and even without  it seems as fast as Chrome on Android. I give this a 4 star rating because there are some issues: 1. Importing bookmarks from Chrome does not work at all. I tried this on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone and my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 and got the same results. 2. There's a strange thing that happens with the screen when rotating from landscape to portrait orientation. The height of the browser window doesn't go to the bottom of the screen. Refreshing the page does not solve the problem  but tapping the control on the phone/tablet to see all open apps - and then going right back into Lightning does solve the problem. Seems like a bit of a bug - which is easy to reproduce every time and on both my android devices. Other than these issues  I think it's worth every penny of the $1.50 for the ad blocking version.,0,1,1,1,130824

Great app! I have been using this app for a while and have saved over 700 books with it. I'm an avid reader  and I use Kindle Unlimited to borrow books to read. If you buy a book from Amazon you can later see if you've read it  but if you borrow one with the Unlimited program and then return it there is no way too see if you've previously borrowed or read a book. It was always a problem remembering which books I had already read. With this app I can keep track of the books I have previously borrowed. I can keep a personal review of each book. It is easy to put the books info into the app by using the ISBN or ASIN number  or you can do an Internet search for the book or enter it manually. You can expand or collapse the list of books making the list quicker to navigate. The app occasionally reminds me to do a back up so I don't lose all that info  and the backups are easy to do. I use this app everyday  and would highly recommend it. It not only lists which books I have previously read  but I can look to see whether I liked the book or the author. Wonderful tool.,0,1,0,1,158963

QKSMS is an excellently designed app  with an attractive interface and a good feature list  all adorned with the benefit of being open-source! Unfortunately  my experience has failed to live up to my hopes  not because of its design  but because of its performance. QKSMS's interface seems to be very laggy and unstable. It will frequently hang for several seconds  or become confused and take me where I wasn't expecting to go. I often have to set my phone down for a few seconds to let the app sort itself out  before I try and navigate back to where I actually wanted to be. It will occasionally close the keyboard without obvious cause  or boot me back to the conversation list while typing a message. Additionally  it doesn't seem to have good MMS support; all of my MMS messages have timestamps from 1970 in the conversation view and all appear at the bottom - despite the fact that long-pressing an MMS message gives a perfectly fine timestamp. I'd love to love QKSMS  but it doesn't seem to love me back. It would be my daily driver if not for the sad bugginess.,1,1,0,1,158296
Originally used to replace widget on Samsung S series phone when built in widget disappeared. Had difficulty at first since when installing only downloads settings icon but not widget itself. Fooled around with it and suddenly the widget started working on phone. It's a great widget working so well on phone I decided to add it to my Samsung Note Tablet 10. Same issue as before. Installed settings icon but no calendar widget even though settings are set to my default calendar. I can't recall how I got widget itself to appear on phone and I'm hardly a mobile device illiterate. Something is wrong when you create an app that doesn't make obvious how to activate full widget. Uninstalled. Waste of space unless you know how to unlock the magic key to get widget itself to appear on screen. Fortunately old widget still working on tablet although it's not as good as one on phone. Going to get new phone soon and wonder what will happen if I try to install this on new device. Useless without widget! Surely I'm not the only one with this issue and nothing on Github.,0,1,1,1,32433
I love the game and all of its mechanics! I have some requests though it may just be because I suck: 1) I think more balancing is needed regarding the chances of what kind of glyph you will get from an arcane stylus. I just get the ones that root or slow the player too often. 2) Vampire bats seem to take rather high amount of health from me and seem to dodge too well too. I don't know  it seems unfair and gets on my nerves. 3) The sniper doesn't have nearly as many advantages compared to the warden  and the assassin to the freerunner. 4) Health potions and food are rarer to come upon. Especially approaching boss level depths. 5) I think access to rings need to be improved. I have frequent games where I do not come across an artefact or other item to fill my other 2 equip slots. And the variety of ring functionality can really change one game from another  if only they weren't so rare. 6) Please nerf the skeleton blasts  in most cases there aren't any means to kill them at a distance and their blasts are rather high for a low level player in my opinion.,1,0,0,1,172849
Great App But Have One Suggestion This is a great app. It annoys me that whenever my phone pairs with my car  it automatically starts playing my music. Sometimes the songs that play are ones that I downloaded for my daughter and even she is embarrassed about them as well. This app lets you determine which apps should playback instead. My suggestion is as follows  and I know this can be accomplished with Tasker but I feel this is way easier to use for Joe Schmo. Please allow the user to designate which app should launch. For example  I use Serius XM to listen to Howard Stern during my drive. It would be awesome if I could get Sirius XM app to launch via Media Button Router. Unfortunately  the Sirius XM app is not recognized as a media playback app so I cannot designate it in the Media Button Router UI. If you allow the user to designate which app they wish to launch  that would be a great advantage for people using apps that are also not recognized as media playback apps. Again  great app. It is a must for anyone wanting full control on their phone.,1,0,1,1,12354
"Bill L There is a problem with keys that have certain attributes (I don't know whether the problem is with the Cipher attributes  the Digest attributes  the Compression attributes  or some combination of the three). <pre> NOT handled correctly by APG: Cipher: AES256  AES192  AES  CAST5  3DES Digest: SHA256  SHA1  SHA384  SHA512  SHA224 Compression: ZLIB  BZIP2  ZIP  Uncompressed Handled correctly by APG: Cipher: AES  TWOFISH  CAST5  BLOWFISH  3DES Digest: RIPEMD160  SHA1 Compression: BZIP2  ZLIB  ZIP  Uncompressed</pre> I have verified this by creating TWO versions of my own public key  one for each of the two different sets of attributes shown above. By """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""not handled correctly""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  I mean that if there is a private key associated with the public key  and you import them  then try to edit them  you find many of the edit-key widgets greyed out; also  if it is a DSA/Elgamal key (like mine is)  then the DSA signing key is not recognized as a signing key.

"I used to use this when I had an old Linux version on my PC that did not support MTP for my phone and it worked great for connecting to Linux or a NetBSD shell account I have on the Internet  etc. But since I upgraded from a Samsung S3 to J7 this app does not even appear to have any way to allow me to add my ssh key that I need to use to connect to my Linux desktop PC or anything else (I normally disallow passwords in Linux to require keys only). When I try to """"""""""""""""Manage Pubkeys"""""""""""""""" it says 'Tap""""""""""""""""Menu"""""""""""""""" button to create or import key pairs'  but where in the world is a """"""""""""""""Menu"""""""""""""""" button on an Android (6.0.1) phone? When I try More > Import  it says """"""""""""""""Pick from /sdcard""""""""""""""""  but the only choice is """"""""""""""""Cancel"""""""""""""""". So it used to work great  but is now totally useless for anyone who wants or needs to use keys instead of passwords  since there is no way to select a key file from internal storage or microSD (sdcard). So while I used to like this app  it is currently non-functional for me at this time.""""",0,0,0,1,17959
