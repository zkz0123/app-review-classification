"This is a great source of information. I would consider some changes in it:- 1. When the page doesn't exist  then please make it as soon as possible. Also if the page is not there  the app should inform that it is not there. There are many blue links but the page doesn't exist and when it is opened  only buffering circle can be seen there. 2. Please provide all the services of wikimedia  if not able  please provide the most essential in this app itself  like wikitionary  wikiquotes  wikisource  etc. Please provide them as widgets or try any other thing that would let the user use all of the wikimedia services in the same app. 3. Please provide the """"categories"""" pages. I have surfed through many pages where category is written. The page has always opened blank. Please provide the categories pages in the app as you have done it on the browser. 4. I love to read articles and gain knowledge. I liked the concept of reading list but I would appreciate it if you please provide a backup in google drive so that whatever article I have saved under the given caption  they should be saved as it is in google drive under same caption as they are given under the Wikipedia folder in google drive. 5. Please provide reliable links for the books. In some articles  the link goes to that page where either the there is no access or there is no book as promised by the link. 6. Please link google id to the wikipedia so that users don't have to make wikipedia. This would also serve the purpose of google drive backup. 7. This is very important. Many books are not available on wikibooks. Please consider to upload the books that can be uploaded in wikibooks as soon as possible. It is really disappointing that after we open a link and we find either no book or some chapters are missing or some pages are missing. 8. I would highly consider to make the wikipedia search engine better. Please provide wide range of keywords so that the desired article can be accessed. These are some generous suggestions to the wikipedia team. I would be extremely happy to know that you would have considered my suggestions. If you have a better option to make available these services  then please do it. The efforts that you have made to available the world's knowledge at doorstep is highly appreciating. I just wanted to make it a little better.",1,0,0,1,108375
"This is probably the most enjoyable game I've played on Android. It is not without its flaws though. It's still under development. It has been for years and in that time it really hasn't progressed much. There are quests you can't finish and roads you can't take with nothing to signify which ones except they don't work. The """"""""""""""""guardian"""""""""""""""" creatures blocking narrow paths quickly become tedious because they're on nearly every single screen. EVERY cave  no matter how big  eventually narrows multiple times to just big enough for two rats or bees or zombies to stand  unmoving  side by side so you have to fight both at once. It gets real old  real quick. Some rewards for boss fights are really  really bad  useless items. Drop rates for the rarest items are ridiculously low at .1% and even .01%. Respawn rates are completely random  meaning a creature blocking a path may respawn right in front of you before you can even move forward after killing it  sometimes more than once. And the story line is severely lacking for a game with so many years of development. In many quests you are forced to choose sides with zero information and the choice you make permanently effects trade and services available. If you're lucky you get some information AFTER you've chosen a side  but even then it's he said  she said every single time with no real explanation. It's all about the reward. You're choosing a side  not to further an exciting story  but as a cheap device to decide which reward you get  which people you can trade with or which services are available. Repeatedly. There is no thinking involved  no weighing of options. You either choose randomly or you look it up to see what you'll get. Horrible quest design. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen. A TON of quests in the really crappy areas you hate going through are """"""""""""""""back and forth"""""""""""""""" busy work. But somehow it's still really entertaining  at least for a week or two.""""",0,0,1,1,3500

"This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read  write and relax  but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing. This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example  instead all we get is the """"""""""""""""discover"""""""""""""""" feature which only promotes bland  vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories  or video game strategies  or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive  to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is  otherwise you have to look it up manually. There are no set categories or tags  instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post  which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers. People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted  discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want. You can't dislike posts or comments  so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways  while WordPress does not. The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear. All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community  and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.""""",1,0,1,1,85647
Devs  this is an awesome app. I've always been a console guy  and this app with a Bluetooth keyboard is  quite simply  THE BOMB. I do have one wish  though. One of the first things I do when I install a new system is swap the capslock and ctrl keys. A lot of the things I do involve control keystrokes  and it's just so much easier to slide my left pinky over and use the capslock key. I haven't figured out how to do that with Termux yet - if you could clue me in to how I might do that  or consider that sort of keyboard remapping as a future feature  I'd be very appreciative. I've literally found no other flaw with Termux - thanks so much for a true killer app. Update: I installed External Keyboard Helper Pro and it lets me do that remapping. I'd still prefer an internal option  since Termux is the only app I need the remapping in  but at least it gets me there. Update 2: Well  I take back that last. External Keyboard Helper Pro seems to work *sometimes*. But it DOES NOT seem to work within Termux. When I'm in my browser  for example  the capslock key works for ctrl-L to get me up to the address bar. But it doesn't work for ctrl-A D to detach from a screen session in Termux. :-( So  devs - can you find us a way to do this remapping within Termux? UPDATE 3: Ok  I did get it to work with External Keyboard Helper Pro  but to do so I had to use a custom mapping on all of the letter keys to tell them to ignore CapsLock. The CapsLock key does seem to function as ctrl  but it was ALSO doing its CapsLock function - so by programming the letter keys to ignore that all seems well. Whew...,1,0,0,0,66698
This is simply fantastic! GNU/Linux CLI in the palm of your hand --with the apt package-manager to boot! (It's a custom repo  but it has a pretty good selection  nonetheless. (The only thing I'm really missing is PDFGREP  and I bet there's a simple way to get it that I am overlooking.)) Oh  and my phone is NOT ROOTED  by the way  and that hasn't kept from me from doing anything yet. You can get Termux-API to add a few more features  like the ability to send and read SMS messages from the command line. You can also import your contacts  and more neat stuff. You get access to your SD card (after enter a short command one time). I was using (or attempting to use) one of the other most popular terminal emulators  but it was less than bare-bones - with no package manager... Needless to say  I was thrilled to discover this one. The controls are easy to adapt to within a day or two. (Volume up or down gives you your CTRL and/or ALT action.) I love running my scripts on my phone  and you just use [ termux-fix-shebang ] to make it executable in the app. (The directory path in Termux is a little longer than just /bin/bash .) I've even got $(apt list) and $(apt show) piping into dialog then into $(apt install) for a quasi-GUI type package manager setup deal. (It's dirty  but it gives me a selection box with descriptions.) Anyways  I could ramble on and on... I tried quite a few other options to have GNU/Linux in my Samsung Galaxy 6  but nothing compares to this. So  get this app if you love BASH! (or dash or zsh or fish ...-- with aptitude installed  you get choices!!!),1,0,0,1,66756
I got this app to figure out what was running in the background as far as data. Did not know what I got till I played with it. All in one monitor app. Obviously an app can't do everything  but this will point you in the right direction. Found the Samsung browser on my s5 was what was wrong with my data. A preinstalled app. So I switched to chrome. After watching it  chrome stays in region. Samng browser was connecting all over. Dublin  Georgia Maine Washington. This app showed me the light if it. Thank you for this app showing me what was really going on with MY damn data. Android sucks. But this makes it better running stock roms. Back to say I am still impressed. I know exactly what my data is doing by IP address. Like I said still finding messed up apps. Disabled stock ones. I don't want to root again.. so with this I can find the apps running and connecting and disable them threw my app manager. This is strictly a window into what your phone is doing. Also quick look ups on IP addresses used by your connections. Update 4/23/17 I can't say enough about this app. Was about to root my phone to get rid of all the junk apps. Well didn't need to because of this app right here showing me what was connecting in the background and what was running my phone dead everyday. It doesn't tell you this. You have to use the app. Look at your connection and running apps. I had apps running I never used. Restricted the background data and Bam. Phone flies again. Between this and old ass s5  makes these new phones look slow. Thank you again guys & gals.,0,0,0,1,66095
"As good as Subsonic will allow. Very nice software. But the Subsonic server (not DSub) has a few issues concerning browsing large collections: You can list 1) albums alphabetically; 2) Genres; or 3) browse the library as file structure (typically Artist\Album) or tags (Artist\Album). But  Subsonic has no handling of multiple artists or multiple genres on one album  even creating problems since semicolon """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""";"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is simply omitted in artists  leading to strange artists like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""BachMozart"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as opposed to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bach; Mozart""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  or one entry """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bach"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and another """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Mozart"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for same album. Can be mitigated somewhat by the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Browse by tags"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" server setting  resulting in an artist called """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bach/Mozart"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Likewise the genre listing suffers when the genre filed has many entries  since each combination of many genres is understood as one new unique genre  e.g. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Jazz; Bob"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is not the same as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bob; Jazz""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  nor """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Jazz""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  nor """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bob"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Many other databases like MediaMonkey  iTunes handles all this excellently  but not Subsonic. Conclusion is that DSub  though as excellent as it gets  is limited when navigate among your 100.000 albums/tracks. DSub still gets 5 stars. But Subsonic  please do fix this.""""",0,1,1,1,173250
I've loved this app. It has been my replacement for quickpic. But with the recent update hid ALL the files in my sd card. I was just trying to hide few folders. Idk what to do. UPDATE AFTER THE DEV'S REPLY: still nothing. It doesn't show any of my files on music apps or the stock gallery. Only in the file explorer. The way this mess started was by me selecting multiple folders and trying to exclude them  as it didn't work  i tried to hide them. Suddenly it gave me several ''unknown error'' bubbles and as i reopened it  it only showed the internal memory files. Nothing on my sd card is visible. I have very vital files in it  so i need a solution. Please. I think it's necessary for me to mention that i uninstalled and reinstalled the app  i also deleted several nomedia files in hopes it would fix my problem  but it didnt. Now that i reinstalled it  if i use the ''temporarily show hidden files1' option it does show me my pictures. But it does not restore my media in general. I cannot listen to my music or audio files in any player  only directly from the file explorers. Finally  i tried what you said in your reply  but the problem is the apo hid files i didn't even hide  so it doesn't even show me an ''unhide'' option for most of them. Please i expect a quick reply. Thanks in advance. Second update:files are finally appearing after trying twice more. Will this be a permanent solution? Can i safely exclude fiolders withtout my files being hidden by .nomedia files again?,1,1,1,1,65505

"Should read battery_current_now  not battery_current I seem to be on a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""quest"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to find any app/widget/piece of software that will do one simple task: read the battery current sensor in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""relative real-time"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - that is  as the CPU scales up and down  GPU kicks in and out  4G modem does its dance  and as all the little things of the system do their work  I can see the immediate response in the current that is MEASURED BY MY PHONE'S SENSOR.

Best app on my phone.. Including phone itself. After trying 7-10 other e-book readers and finding multiple issues with each one  I stumbled across this one (thinking it looked so basic it was gonna be another crappy one) with nothing to lose...6 years and 7 phones later it remains my all time favorite  and most used app ever. I use it by far more often than any other app  including the phone dialer. Every new phone I've gotten this has always been the first app to go on  and flawless syncing with FB reader and Google drive means I just have to download and sign in on new phone and everything is right in the world again.. plus I can pick up any of my multiple devices and open to same spot no matter what device I stopped on.. Can't go on enough about how much i love this reader.. bought the premium version not because the free one was lacking.. Honestly if I never even open the premium version and kept using the free one it will be worth the price after the years of enjoyment from free one.. Really just buying it to thank developers. Couple of small changes might make it PERFECT (really I'm nit picking here) 1. Auto scroll would be awesome for people like me who need larger font so we don't need to turn page every 3 servings 2. Pinch to adjust font size (for same reason) 3. Bookmarking could be made easier with dedicated space in corner... And that's all I can think of that isn't perfect,1,1,0,1,287868
Something is seriously wrong with the setup process... Pass code initially recv'd was unable to enter as either the app or my cell auto skipped by that screen thus invalidating that code... Unable to find an answer in the FAQS messaged support asking if it would effect the functionality... Response did not answer my question and from what I can tell one can't simply enter a new pass code anywhere once installed.. Therefore uninstall  cleared cache and reinstalled.. The new code support sent obviously no longer worked and a new one was never recv'd... Another problem as when you click the pass code not received another one is sent but kicked out of the pass code screen no water to get back to it... A message in the app has a link to click if pass code not received and a timer pops up saying a rep w call you back... Clicked 2x's and no return call after waiting much longer than the less than 2 min displayed... Deleted as this is simply annoying... Had their support answered my question correctly to begin with don't think I'd be as irked wasting my time or called as didn't ask for a call back so don't add a msg saying someone will when they don't... also annoying... Work in IT and completely understand issues happen either w the app even possibly my error yet not much patience when misinformation... Delete...,0,1,0,0,151309
"When trying the Android app (with offline map pack for the UK) today when using the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature I encountered two bugs which make using the app an incredibly frustrating experience: * When in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode the app does not keep the screen awake so after the phones """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""period of inactivity"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is reached the screen is switched off. This is incredibly frustrating as I had my phone in a case and I had to take it out of the case to switch the screen back on. * When in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode and using the offline maps if you switch out of the app (i.e. using the task switch button in Android) and back into the app the maps completely disappear  the route is still visible (i.e. the lines) but everything else is gone. The only way I've found to fix this is to stop """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and start it all over again! I found this issue due to the previously mentioned issue where the screen would turn off. When I switched the screen back on and went back into the app the maps were gone. I would appreciate if the developer(s) of the app could fix this as the bugs mentioned above make navigation using """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" a real painful experience.""""",1,1,1,0,165096
"Just what I was looking for to track family games This app was perfect for my needs. Needed something that I could easily keep score in various games and customize the values so that it was quick and easy to use and get rid of paper & pen. This app did that  and it had what it needed to do it well. Things like keeping the screen on  and also being smart enough that if I hit +500 +100 +100 that I was saying +700 for that person for a turn. Works perfectly. Now my only 3 things I would love to see to make this app even better. 1.) When exporting to PDF find a way to export all that same information that you can see in the game history like in the app. Then you can make nice tables/graphs in excel with the data and see the nice time/score layouts. 2.) The 4 on screen buttons are by far the most important for me playing games with high point values. I was able to work with just 4 but it would be nice if you could customize to add a few more if desired. 3.) I have not made a mistake YET but I know I will especially with drinking games. If I hit +500 points to somebody and meant to hit +100 I wish there was either an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""undo"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button or there was a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""inverse"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button.

"Best TTS so far! I've been using this the day I got my new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and it has tremendously helped with my language learning instead of reading it all the time! :3 Though I do like it paired with Read Aloud  another awesome tool I have for selecting text and listening to my selection in my target learning language  I do have a few minor issues. For some odd reason  the Notify and Read Aloud apps do not automatically detect the languages I select in Read Aloud and only goes with a default language I set. This means I have to manually set the language I want read  which is very annoying. In addition  the language detection percentage found in Read Aloud does not work at all in my heavy testing. One other problem I have is the headset I plug in my phone used to read the audio stream I set to read aloud doesn't seem to work anymore.

"Does what it claims; and that's the best that can be said. I don't have the time it would take to describe all the ways this app is disappointing.

"Hi. First of all let me thank you for the continued support of the Alarm Klock application. I've been happily using it for many years. However  I'm very unhappy about the new UI. Everything is more complicated now. Consider changing the time of the alarm (which is something I do often): previously you clicked the alarm and you could start changing the time. Now you have to long-click the alarm  then click the time  an only then you can change it. Why make it more complicated? What's the purpose? Other problems: - maximum volume-increase interval is now 60 seconds. In the old app I used 90 seconds and I was happy about it. Why did this had to be disabled? What's so wrong about 90 seconds? - the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""increase/decrease by 1 minute"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" buttons are missing. You now have to fiddle with the system keyboard to achieve this. Inconvenient. - icons are used instead of texts.

PD Is amazing... But just one small complaint I've been playing Pixel Dungeon give or take about 4 years  and I loved it from the beginning. There was a point where I had a hard time keeping up with the game because of all of the updates that was over a year ago so I'm going to try it again. It has been a source of inspiration in my D&D play  and it has never ceased to keep me entertained  no matter how hard or easy I may find it. I especially enjoy a game that is well built  evenly balanced  and takes up less than 30 megabytes of information as if to say; I've been thinking about your Hardware  and I appreciate your patronage. The only time I've had a problem with this game glitching up was due to my own Hardware  completely irrelevant to this game. Except for every so often  I'll touch one part of the screen and my character will want to go the long way  or something out of the way of where I was attempting to go. I don't know if that's a hardware or software problem  but I've encountered it on multiple devices. Regardless this game is fun to play in my opinion. And for those of you with Android consider yourself lucky because you have to pay for it on Steam Powered and iOS all things considered I still think it's worth it!,0,1,0,1,42686

This app is so good it makes too much sense for it to be a stock android app. That would make things too easy. I am a die hard Android fan  but we all know Android tends to make things as multistep as possible in order to avoid user frustration and increase security. I opened this app  did exactly one search and after the app immediately opened since I apparently only had one that started with swiftly  I immediately came here to rate this app. One of the problems I have with next launcher is that the search function requires you to click inside the searchbox  which is at the very top of the screen  making this an inconvenient and inefficient task on my note 5. This app already has the cursor ready to go so you can just type. I immediately knew this is one of the best apps I have ever installed and I have purchased and downloaded many good apps. This app makes it less exhausting to have an android phone. I would die before owning an iphone  but since I like having a clean homescreen and I like to be able to access any app from any screen  I am regularly using shortcut and gesture apps  which is a lot to remember in itself  so having an app that just cuts out two steps improves the entire user experience of my phone.,0,1,1,1,43344

It might have been a fluke. ---------- Installed this app because the amount of storage left on my phone has been low and I wanted to see what apps/files were taking up the most space and move them over to my SD card.

Constantly up to date and always ahead of every other IM  sometimes also ahead with features not present even in some other applications like (video players  image editing  cloud storage and media management). I really like it. I admire their product life cycle and their releases which are very often and fast  Telegram must have good scrum masters  developers and management for sure :D I would like to see more attention involved in the Cloud Storage management  because it is very easy in the current version to delete accidentally a chat and therefore lose all your cloud storage with that chat. Maybe we can have a lock with pin/password/email confermation to delete a chat which we mark as 'important' and on the other hand to delete 'unimportant' chat could be without asking for password/pin/email confermation. I would also like to see a better organization of chats  groups  channels  so for example  when you have 4-5 private group where you are collecting info and stuff about 4-5 cities (1 city for each group)  then you want to have those groups grouped together in a 'master group' called for examples 'Cities for holiday'... and some other improvements are needed :) Good job!!!!!!!!,1,0,0,1,139481
Mixed feelings I've played this game for a long time; i have partecipated in the online community. I enjoyed Andor's Trail  but i have some issues with it. some pretty BIG issues. First  this (very nice  very well written RPG) requires you to grind .. a lot. And to be honest  that's not entirely bad - it's a mobile-phone RPG  so the grinding actually comes useful at times  when you have a moment of boredom during your day  waiting for the bus  at lunch  or whatever  just open it  grind a few mobs  and put it back in your pocket. But you will need to grind quite a lot to advance in the story. Second  while the game is very nice ... it's not finished. NOWHERE near finished. It will never be. There's not been a single update in a whole year and there was ONE update in the year before that. I've basically been playing it since early 2011 and i've seen a two updates  one very minor  since. And that's a real shame  since the story and writing are so good. But after playing it basically every day for two years straight i just couldn't take it anymore and deleted it. Android is just not a good platform to build a full bodied RPG. Sorry guys  but honestly i can't be asked to wait forever.,1,1,0,1,3325
Is a pity this app is neglected (no blame for dev  whose situation & priorties I can't know) but FCs and stability issues now mar a brilliant concept. Vim is actually a great fit for Android: complete navigation and selection control by word/line/block with just the standard keyboard (no wasted screenspace) & split (particularly diffsplit) are killer features that no other editors come close to. Being able to open additional files without exiting app or fiddling w/ menus is also a big plus (hadn't realized how much using slide out menus or the recent apps menu disrupted my process until now). FCs and associated risk of data loss relegate this to being essentially a demo. Still can't bring myself to uninstall though because I WANT it to work so badly. There are a few other issues: word-based input waits for autocorrect to finish before vim gets any input - so many commands are unworkable & you must watch keyboard's prediction row to see what you've typed. Editing .vimrc and other setup involving home directory was also a bit fiddly (though  if I could figure it out it can't be that bad). Overall Vim on Android is hard to argue with  hopefully updates remedy the outstanding issues.,1,1,0,1,36541
"I think a lot of reviewers have missed the point of this app. If all you want to do is send a regular SMS though your phone's provider then this probably isn't the app for you. It is most powerful when coupled with WebSMS  allowing me to automatically send messages for certain number prefixes through a cheaper web-based provider. My first complaint is that it could look a little prettier. It's not as ugly as WebSMS but a little padding around the text could make all the difference. Perhaps the developer wanted to fit as much text on the screen as possible but screens are relatively large and high resolution these days. The """"""""""""""""Black"""""""""""""""" theme is also more like grey under the Material Glass theme for some reason. With those two issues fixed  it would look much like the stock Messaging app. My next complaint is that starting a new thread fires up the WebSMS interface instead of allowing you to type into SMSdroid directly. This inconsistency is a little jarring and there seems little reason for it. I guess SMSdroid is simply lacking a recipient selector. My last complaint is a minor one. The multi-select button doesn't actually do anything. All in all  a thumbs up from me.""""",1,1,1,1,50192
Almost 5 stars This is a great app  especially considering the fact it's emulating the Dreamcast and fairly new. There are 2 things that stop me from giving it that extra star  and it's only because I'm spoilt from ePSxe. 1. Exiting the app via the Home button quits the game without warning. Every once in awhile I'll accidentally hit it (or hit it on purpose  forgetting it doesn't work the same way ePSxe does)  losing a ton of progress. (In case anyone doesn't know how ePSxe works  it remembers the state the game was in after you leave the app  allowing you to restore the game the next time you come back.) 2. Save states. This is mainly only a problem because of the first one. With ePSxe I had 3 options if I wanted to take a break or do something else quickly on my phone. Find a save point (not as easy in most games)  save states or close the game and restore it later  keeping my progress. With Reicast my only option is to find a save point  which are scarce. Unlike the actual consoles these emulators emulate  there's usually countless times you have to urgently close the app due to phone calls or text messages. It's still a really great app and definitely worth getting  though.,0,1,1,1,5473

A very useful app for stamping location information on to photographs. This could be immensely helpful for anyone involved in any sort of field work. It would be good to have some alternatives to the default positioning of the stamp in the bottom right of the image. Using the phone's microphone to trigger the taking of photos is also useful for field work. I found that the saying 'cheese' option worked well but the 'loud sound' trigger didn't (even at high sensitivity). That's a pity because I would rather use some other sound trigger than 'cheese'  e.g. a whistle. Again  from a field work perspective  it would be good to be able to record a brief linked voice annotation/note with each picture because that would provide an efficient way of adding additional context information to the picture. That would be much better than a simple text annotation which would quickly become a pain if taking multiple pictures on a field trip. Adding voice annotation  however  would require the willingness of the developer to extend the app a bit more in the location awareness arena  e.g. storing location waypoints and linked media (photo  audio  text) in  say  GPX format for use in other apps.,1,0,0,1,169036
This app would be amazing if it works properly. I tested it a lot in last two weeks and haven't got proper results.There are some problems or uncertaintes which should be solved: 1) motion trigger don't behave independent of regular snapshot interval. When I set motion trigger it still takes snapshots in regular intervals (refresh time)! The motion events inside the refresh time(with base of last motion event) are ignored! - I think that the refresh time for regular intervals and motion trigger parameters should be split and don't interact. Otherwise the behaviour is rather inpredictable. 2) motion triggers are not precise  the reaction is sometimes delayed or in interaction with other parameters  it is very uncertain. 3) trigger burst (at least for motion event) doesn't work at all. It always takes 1 picture. 4) when I set SD card directory which is not writable  application next time hangs or doesn't work properly  without any warning.The configuration in whole is not error safe  the input values are not checked for validity. Anyway I hope that this my investigation will help improve this app...as it wasn't updated for 1 and half year. And I'd pay for it if it gets solved.,1,1,0,0,8552
Mostly useful for techy types. Great monitoring tool  but I didn't notice that it increased my WiFi reception  or stabilize my connection. Even on a large phone (LG Spectrum II)  I found the text output of the monitoring screen difficult to read. The app reminiscent of the old PC OS tools that reported everything the OS was doing. If the developer would use a more graphic oriented interface  it would be more useful to lay users. Other users complained that WiFi Fixer was a battery hog  however  I found using the settings to stop monitoring of services kept WiFi fixer from zapping battery life. However  this effectively reduces WiFi Fixer's usefulness. The developer should update the interface to specify which category of services to disable. For instance  disable monitoring screen handlers  app managers  but continue to monitor network activity. I found this app less than useful  but safe for my phone. The developer should consider updating the UI to a GUI  and add selective monitoring  and packet buffering to help stabilize connectivity  and well as a warning when the phone is switching from WiFi to carrier data  or when the WiFi signal is too low to maintain a connection.,1,0,0,1,69120
Overall  Sky Map is a great application. It is perfect for the beginner astronomer  as well as those looking to learn more about astronomy  and familiarize themselves with the solar system. It includes many convenient features such as the ability to enable and disable the appearance of stars  constellations  planets  and much more. The feature I enjoyed the most was the ability to ‚Äútime travel.‚Äù I could easily enter a date and time  (past or future)  and view the solar system at that moment. This feature also allowed me to observe the changes in space that had occurred  or that would occur between the present and the time selected. Sky Map was able to accurately determine my location  and display celestial objects in relation to my position. An element that should be incorporated into this app is the ability for users to view information about any given celestial object they select. This would provide a more educational experience for those interested in furthering their knowledge about celestial objects  rather than just where they are located. In conclusion  this is an easy to operate  yet highly capable app that many astronomers  both new and experienced will enjoy.,1,0,1,1,167729

"Awesome! Pros: I have been looking for an app like this ever since I rooted my Gallaxy S2 back in the day and installed Cyanogenmod losing the voice notifications the Samsung built in! I ditched it in favor of a Nexus 5 when it launched. This app works really well and I love all the options! It is heading in a great direction! It is ready for daily use! Cons: As many other reviewers have pointed out the privacy concerns of having your messages read aloud is a bit of a problem. I hope that is addressed in future updates. I like that you can have it announce the app name only but in some cases I would like to know the senders name to know if it is worth my time to open. Possible Improvements: Having a feature that would read only """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""x"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" amount of characters of the message could cover the privacy issue until it is possible to identify senders. It would also be nice to see varying permission for each app  for instance %t + %m / %t / %m. Also  and this is a little nit picky  it would be nice if it would announce """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""New email"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" instead of just """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Email"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for all messaging/email/chat style apps.""""",1,1,0,1,361
"Compared with the Sword Project app on iOS (PocketSword)  I was very pleased to discover that this """"And Bible"""" app also supports: * multiple synchronized windows * verse comparisons for multiple translations * off-line text-to-speech audio. Some enhancements found in the iOS PocketSword app that I would also like to see here: 1. Display commentary for an entire chapter (just like an entire Bible chapter is displayed)  and not just commentary for one verse. 2. Immediately display the footnote info when I tap on the highlighted footnote letter (just like a Strong's number definition is immediately displayed) instead of requiring me to first select the verse and then choose from the context menu """"Footnotes and references"""". 3. Show results from my previous 'find' so that I can easily visit each search result and not have to repeat the search. 4. Add the ability to download new modules from user-defined locations. I already have many text & commentary modules shared from a non-public server  and it was awkward to have to manually copy them onto the Android device. But even without these requested enhancements  I'm happy to have a Sword Project compatible app on Android!",1,0,0,1,282986
"Even though I tried this with different keyboards it's editing capabilies are poor. They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet. Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled. One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or  for example  undo deletions. rather than sweat coding more editor functions  simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible. There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic. being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one. Again  this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch. Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side. I realize there is a screen real estate issue  especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone  but perhaps that's a case of """"""""""""""""you shouldn't be doing that"""""""""""""""".

I have been getting more knowledgeable and skilled at MH4U  and I consider this app a godsend; such a handy wealth of information right in my hands  all offilne to boot :) This app is a must have for any hunter  especially newcomers. However  there ARE a few problems that prevent this app from truly being great: 1. Optimization - The app works fine on my main phone  a Samsung Galaxy S5  but on my backup phone which is an Alcatel model  some features don't work. Namely the Armor Set Builder; that just doesn't work at all. 2. There are no 3D renders of armor pieces or weapons; I think that would be a cool addition. 3. While I see items needed to craft Palico DLC outfits & weapons  it isn't stated in the app. There's also no mention of normal Palico outfits/weapons either. Showing this info would come in pretty handy. 4. It would be EXTREMELY useful to showcase quest trees; that is  prerequisites to a specific quest. 5. There's little to no mention of G rank quests. 6. Some information is missing  primarily related to the uses/descriptions of some items. 7. Fatalis has no materials data; everything says 0%. If those things could be addressed  then that would be 5 stars!,1,1,1,1,40679
"What happened to the full editor??!!! Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird  useless version of what it was before.

"I have used this app for years  but some of the changes you have made recently just don't make sense. JuiceSSH works much better. I use Dyndns with pinhole ports through my router  my home Linux systems can be accessed either on a 192.168.1.x IP address on my home network or using an uncommon port on the Internet IP address of the router using PNAT to the correct SSH server. In my Connectbot  each server has two entries  one with its internal IP and the other with its Dyndns address. The icon functionality used to make some sense but now it does not. If you accessed a server successfully once before  it used to give a green tick by the server name  not it's a red exclamation mark. If a server hasn't been accessed for two days  it didn't used to matter on previous versions  the green tick would be there to show the last access worked. Now you get a """"No Entry"""" sign  which makes no sense. I also have a problem on my old Nexus 7 tablet on Android 4.3 where when I try to import keys that are in the internal storage  it goes straight to Amazon Drive to try to find the keys with no option to go back to the find them on the local device. It seems to be a backwards step.",0,1,0,0,18025
For years  this was the best Android mail app available. It's unbelievable how the current developers have ruined such a fantastic email utility. Many of the old behaviors have been modified to work in unintuitive ways  demonstrating a lack of basic user ergonomics. The Unified Inbox in particular is a catastrophe. Now  unread messages show before read messages regardless of date or time. Read messages do not show at all (they completely disappear from Unified Inbox) UNLESS YOU READ THEM WITH ANOTHER CLIENT (such as your desktop PC). If you read a message with another client  it will appear below the list of unread messages  completely out of time/date order. The Unified Inbox worked perfectly in older versions  but whoever has been modifying the code for this section of K-9 is essentially incompetent. There should be settings to configure the Unified Inbox behavior back to the old method if a user prefers that. It is after all the reason most of us switched to K9 in the first place. But the current behavior of showing messages read on another client in one way  and messages read in K-9 in another way  is just extremely poor development  and it needs to be fixed.,1,0,1,1,279291
Easily the best 100 bucks you will never spend. Even an old beat to heck psp can set you back a pretty penny and that is without the games  even then there is the fact that one is the size of a small brick. So why bother with all that when you can get it for free with better visuals and audio? Simple you would need a monumental hole in your head. This has taken almost everything that I have tossed its way and done very well. All at full fps and with some really good graphics. However it is not perfect. Things to know  if you are a fan of Armored Core like me  Last Raven doesn't really work. If that were working I would drop a dozen stars. Also some other games do not always work smoothly  but hey  it's free right. You will need a powerful phone however. Emulators by nature are power  memory and hard-drive hogs. This is no exeption. Minimum is a Samsung Galaxy S 5 with at least 32 gigs of space. Best bet  Moto Droidz or anything really powerful. IPhones and windows phones are not recommended due to their locking of software. Jailbreaking in can void your warenty. That said  exellent work. And give gold a shot  these guys can use all of the support they can get.,0,0,1,1,56531
"Very good - and could be better; 4 3/4 stars. This does exactly what it's supposed to do - tells you where you are  where you're going  approximate altitude and all the other good stuff. I've used it in light aircraft and as a passenger on commercial jet flights and it works wonderfully. A couple of things could be better: *** Storage - Avare downloads and stores a lot of map data  and getting an Android phone to store that on the SD card rather than the phone's memory is a chore. I've done this on four devices and it's been manual every time. Create a directory on the SD card  then point Avare to store maps there. Then curse when it doesn't work the first time. With maps.me doing it at the push of a button  I'd wholeheartedly advocate this as an upgrade. Heck  I'd PAY for it - if it saved me an hour's fussing it'd be worth every penny. Just sayin' ****Flight planning. Not as intuitive as you might imagine - again it takes fussing. Since I most often use the app as a reference (""""""""""""""""where the heck am I"""""""""""""""") rather than as a guidance method  this isn't such a problem for me but I've heard complaints about it.

A decent free Subsonic app...but UltraSonic is still somewhat better For free  I cannot complain. I wanted an app to connect to my Ampache server via HTTPS and this worked. Bandwidth limitation to help save some data usage on mobile is a huge plus! It has a much better interface than then any other free Subsonic apps  and above and beyond any native Ampache apps (mostly all dead anyway). Still  it is not without its limitations. The audio focus is way off. Not only does it mute the music when navigation kicks in  but it mutes the navigation audio as well. Kind of useless at this point. Gapless playback is not available (the first attempt to play streaming ogg files will just stop and skip to the next song after 20 seconds; would have to skip back to play correctly...just got annoying after a while). It's a good app for those that don't really expect or need too much. But  it lacks quite a bit that Ultrasonic (also free...but dead project) does better (list by album title  gapless playback  correct audio focus  and being able to list my video catalog and play them). Since the Ultrasonic project looks like it's dead  I'm really hoping this one will catch up.,0,0,0,1,16461
Though infrequently updated - and going to check his website and toss him a few dollars if he accepts. For FREE(!) this app is beyond all expectations. I have over 1300 books in it. the ability to sync to good reads (at least receive from  believe send to is broken)  cross reference with library things  keep track of loans to people  and backup reminders (and the backups work!) are an amazing value. Let me explain the basic process. 1.) Download this app and good reads app 2.) link to goodreads and librarythings 3.) Open good reads and use their UPC scanner to scan in everything you own indiscriminately. Try to organize on teh good reads side if you feel inclined. 4.) Sync from good reads (one way  if send is still broken) - all books  their covers  synopsis  page count - all data is now in book catalogue. You can search by auther  borrowed  and more. Saves me from re-buying books - since 1300 is a little hard to keep track of. Furthermore  unlike the good reads app - this works offline. I can also give a copy to friends if they want to borrow they have a copy of my database. My favorite android app - yes  synergy between others  but the developer did it!,0,0,0,1,158607
Buffering issues are ruining my afternoon commute. I'm an NPR fan and in particular a Morning Edition and All Things Considered junkie. I can get my fix of Morning Edition with my local affiliate station but on the way home I depend on the NPR News app. However  the failure of the audio segments to properly buffer means that the first minute (or five) of each individual story is nothing but choppy bits of sound and long pauses. I wind up missing most of the context and spend the entire story trying to figure out what it is actually about. If the people behind the app are having trouble getting their buffering settings right then at least give us the option to download the audio files in their entirety. I've got more than enough storage (50GB). Add a setting that will either allow or disable audio downloads over cell networks (WiFi only) and you've got people's cellular data concerns covered too. Delete the files when the playlist is cleared and you're good to go. I'd be happy to spend a good minute or two before leaving work downloading all the files for ATC so I can have a more pleasant and informative drive home.

Motorola Defy +  Android 2.3. Works as advertised. Sky view follows phone screen orientation accurately  both in azimut and in elevation. 4 stars only due to comparison with SkEye  as I haven't found how Sky Map can show basic details for the celestial body at the screen center and how Sky Map can show celestial position of the screen center (SkEye can show this information). Allows to search a specific celestial body (but you need to remember the name as you have to type it; I could not find a list of celestial bodies  list that is available with SkEye) and shows on the screen an arrow allowing to orientate the screen towards the searched body. It is not always clear if the GPS position has locked correctly: it is necessary to use an other application to check that the GPS position is being acquired properly (SkEye shows when starting the GPS status with number of visible and used satellites and informs when a GPS position has been acquired properly). Small foot print (less than 0.5MB) and can be moved to SDCard. No adds that I could see. So far good enough for me although I prefer SkEye for the reasons described previously.

You're fighting on 15 pressing quickly  die and press no to the ahnk. Move the 'no' away from creatures or set a delay please. I enjoy this game  I don't enjoy dying after ninety minutes in a good game. Ideas for additions: Add a 'throb entire screen red when hp is low (and maybe players can set the percent)'  space the buttons so the game can be played on devices with small screens without searching when trying to rest for one enemy's step  fix auto-pathing (it currently paths based on enemies that are not visible and steps back and forth when no path is available)  bugfix the autopathing arrow after a fight (frequently only advances one step or disappears without other actions)  fix the wand of reach (does not switch with enemies as the description states) and a few other things. Keep up the good work on adding things just don't forget the main priority is to have it function well. I am a person who likes to donate yet I do not appreciate improvements when known problems exist  it just compounds the issue and it is the reason software such as Windows exists with great feature bloat and so many bugs the average user is always upset about something.,1,1,0,1,42676
"Yes  it's a rather geeky app and you need to have a telnet client  such as the command line one Windows comes with that you can get in """"Turn Windows features on or off""""  or PuTTY. But once you connect to it  it's very straightforward to use. Just type into the terminal window and your keystrokes appear instantly on the Android device. If you can't figure out telnet  there's another remote keyboard app out there that uses a web interface  but you still need to enter some numbers in a browser to connect. (Or buy a bluetooth keyboard  it's simpler still.) I prefer this one because I like the simplicity of telnet and like the """"send to PC"""" button at the bottom right of the phone screen  to send whatever's in the text box to the PC. It's a great way to get URLs out to a PC (or send a bunch of text up to be processed with a regex and then pasted back to the phone) while you're using Remote Keyboard. Manual ROT-13 encryption is a strange feature to include  but alright I guess. I'd really prefer if there were an option to have real encryption  either with telnet over SSL (if the user can puzzle out how to create such a connection)  or even better  SSH.",1,0,0,1,110653

Needs Work!! Since I use gVim every day at work and home  I was glad to see this for Android  so I installed it. Then my phone kept rebooting. I'm an IT Architect  so I knew what to do. It took me a while -- a couple of weeks  of uninstalling a couple of other apps along with this one (the apps I had installed just before the phone started rebooting)  then re-installing them (over days!) and then uninstalling  and so on. As I say  that took many days  since I would have to wait for a couple of days to see if the phone would reboot or not .I finally was able to conclusively prove that it was only after I installed Vim Touch that the phone kept rebooting. I have now had it uninstalled for a couple of weeks  I've reinstalled the other apps  and my phone is not rebooting. Since it does not run all the time in the background  all I can figure is that there is something that is going haywire during the install itself  causing problems later on. File corruption? Something not being registered right? I haven't done any Android development  just UNIX and Linux (since 1980!)  so I don't know what to tell you.

"Very useful software Its a very useful software  but there is one little suggestion that I have that I think can improve it. If you can make this application detect whether the user is actively using the device or not  and if they are using it  then there isn't any point to send the notification. Because they are seeing the notification themselves on the device. For example if you can make an option in the configuration page of the application  something like: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Send notifications only when the device is locked."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and the application detects that the phone is locked (not in use physically) it should send the notification  otherwise not. That too could be an 'option' of course for those who'd like to opt for it. The reason I am saying this could be useful is because in my Ubuntu setup  I keep a record of all the notifications like android. So all of the notifications that I received when I was away are stacked. Now  when I am away from my computer  I am probably using my phone. So when i come back  at times i have up to 50 or 60 notifications which all of them I have read on the phone. Do you think this is possible?""""",1,0,0,1,29574

Website and App Syncing Needed! The app has evolved and delivers a much better experience than when I first downloaded it. I have been able to listen to NPR program without much hassle and only intermittently experience playback issues or glitches. I think that the app is becoming quite polished and I appreciate your dedication to updating the catalog of audio files by bringing more shows to the app. One improvement that I would like to see is an integration between the website and your apps. Sometimes I find myself browsing NPR and wishing I could continue a story on my mobile device at a later point if I am on the move. The addition of a saved articles or read-it-later type functionality would be awesome. Another key feature would be a unified playlist that syncs between app and our profiles on the website. I like to stream your app in my car and it would be nice to add stories I am interested in from my computer and play them on my mobile device when I get into my car. Currently  there does not appear to be any profile functionality on the mobile app. Keep up the great work. I really enjoy using this app as a source for news and culture.,1,1,0,1,162840

Nice job  guys! ======================================================================================== Update: It seems tasks are laid out according to GMT  rather than local time  on the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Due"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tab (Today  Tomorrow  Next Days  Someday). Due dates display correctly in editing and on the server. This makes it a bit difficult to see what you've entered for Tomorrow  as it appears as Today  etc. There's also some inconsistency when dealing with subtasks. It seems there may be two or more standards for specifying them: one way wherein the subtask is entered as a new line in the Description field  and another using a more formal specification. Otherwise a nice little app. Looking forward to paying a few bucks for it once the kinks are worked out.""""",0,0,0,1,96230
Ok google officially you are crap. Out of the 30% now rate this as one star. Is that a clue to sort this stupid piece of code out. It is not an app as it bears the user no benefit. I have bought an app. It now tells me it wont run unless I update this.. you are holding me to ransome. Why should a purchase need me to use your code??. Your car is needs petrol but still works when you use texaco or bp. It does not stop on the freeway because you use a different petrol provider. SORT IT. Every time there is an update more of MY data not YOURS gets sucked down. Now you want sms messages access to protected areas take our contacts. If the police wanted this data they need a warrant  no google wants this and its rediculous permissions to be accepted. Shame on you google. Bugger me wants to control nfc..... This is supposed to be a piece of software that enables third party apps not a stealth data stealing weasel. Apps that used to work require an update to this ----- why---- because Google insists  not necause the app needs it. It is so you have to have this malware on board.... Come on let it do what it is supposed to do  be an enabler.,1,1,1,0,232358
First and maybe only review. I had a botched update to my phone (sony....worst computer software ever.) Anyway the net result is that I couldn't access the settings on my android phone  I couldn't access the homescreen or the app drawer or basically anything  by some miracle I could just about get to the custom lockscreen I had  and by receiving a text in this crippled state I was able to get to the messages app  which still had all my messages  so I knew the data was there. I tried various programs to get the SMS off the phone onto my computer but none of them worked as it relied on going to the settings which was inaccessible for me :/ By some crazy bodging I managed to get to the wifi setting and turn on my wifi  and also managed to get to the app store to subsequently open this app  finally I connected it to my gmail account and pressed backup....and it did! 2-3 hours after the botched update I'm now sitting looking at my phone slowly tick off all the sms and seeing them appear in my gmail  this beautiful app saved my arse and earned my loyalty  when I have a spare few quid  this dev is getting a donation! Major Kudos o7,1,0,0,0,21492

im not sure there is any real point unless theres a device too stupid to know when a new file was added and automatically count it in the list (sounds like some devices werent thought up carefully but whatever). as for my device anytime a new file is added its automatically counted  which is odd for a piece of garbage device like mine. the external storage is auto-scanned anyway upon mounting so this app seems pointless to me  but it is fun to goof off with so ill give that much. in any case my only problem is that despite specifying the directory (external) it still scans the internal. but it also scans the external as well. now if we can get it to only scan the specified and not the other as well (if the file path is /sdcard0 it should only scan sdcard0  if its sdcard1 to only scan sdcard1 - not both). also we should also be allowed to not put /storage/ or /mnt/ before .... if i want to only put /sdcard0/ it should scan even though /storage/ wasnt added. the reason is because it should already know the /storage/ (or /mnt/) part so we shouldnt have to specify that in the directory. just where its going from there.,1,1,0,1,32100
Very nice app. Could you come up with the on off switch designed by checkbox? By that it wouldn't go off automatically  and stay on until the checkbox is unchecked. You can make it better by showing pending access  access log and data usage. For pending access another third option is needed between access and no access  ask for access type. Challenge is not to increase the size  shall see forward to your updates. Grey shirts would have been perfect if only checkbox was used instead of push button. OK  rating is updated :-) you already have a on off switch  slider type. I'm asking to replace it with checkbox  that little box with a right sign when checked  that takes even less space than slider. And keep in mind other possible improvements. No it's that orange slider switch at the front screen which makes the firewall itself on and off. What else your app does other than blocking the connection? Ya  checkboxes cannot be unchecked automatically without human input. That's way I'm asking to use checkbox instead of slider or push button. Everything else can make it better is already said. Shall check out your updates.,1,0,1,0,96592
"I love this app and  for the most part  can't imagine another that would enable users simpler access to the key features this app offers. Any attempt to make it more sophisticated would DISTRACT (from the main goals for using such a program) and would DETRACT (from its powerful and yet wonderfully simple-to-use functions). Worth mentioning  however  is that  after the program having worked perfectly on my former Galaxy S5 with Lollipop (Android 5)  I switched to an Alcatel Icon 4 with Marshmallow (Android 6) and found that  every time I tried to start using the app  I would respond """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Yes"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to the initial dialogue pop-up asking if I wanted to Download a bible version  yet the program kept then showing an error msg like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""...cannot connect to the Internet.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

"I am completely lost as to why this app gets so many good reviews  because for me  it is AWFUL - at least as far as custom decks are concerned. It is far too over-complicated. Bear witness. Even trying to explain why it is so terrible will be confusing  and then bear in mind  working with the app is even worse. For example  it totally tries to own when and what I can study. It disappears my cards if it thinks I have studied them enough  forcing me to go and figure out how to put them back into the study session based on how many days to advance my """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""review"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" session. If I want to set up a custom study session to force it to allow me to study what I want  when I want  again it disappears the original deck - where I can no longer """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""browse"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" my list of cards  which btw  I have to do whenever I want to see a custom field because the app does not make it easy to add the field to the study deck.

GRATE Start 1st off I waited a few weeks to test it out before doing this write up I found a few problems in the core of the setup of it  when a user dos not send his key ID with the encrypted file it will not do a search for a good key (GPG and PGP do) I do not send Key ID with messages for safety reason and not all pgp messages I send are in stranded E-mail when the key ID is not there it thinks it is a PW protected and dos not check for the keys. (That should be fixed ASAP) I also would like to see a way to do more advanced configurations like you can with most desk top client. Both those things are big deals with me. For that it is only a 3 star. Removed one star for each problem I had. Do not let that make you think this is not a good thing to use though. I still do. I need to know one thing not tested as of now but when certifying keys can you pick the certification of the key? and add notes to the cert? (Both of those things I would like to see too if it is not there) I do use a key policy URL so I would like to use it on the phone app too if possible. Thanks for bringing GPG/pgp to our phones.,1,1,1,1,15848

This is an OK app but it does have two issues. The first one is... it does Not offer automatic rotational viewing. So in other words  on my Samsung phones the content is displayed in portrait mode when my phone is charging in landscape mode. From what I can gather Dashclock uses the display mode that your phone is last on when it activates. So if your Homescreen is able to rotate like on a tablet  then no problem. However  if you're using a phone and your homescreen locks at only portrait mode then when Dashclock starts while you're charging... everything will be displayed sideways. The only way around that would be to open up any app that rotates  like Gmail for instance...then Dashclock will be displayed properly if your phone is in landscape mode. I did that until I found a rotational app that rotates my homescreen only when it's plugged in. The second issue/bug I found is a biggie. When Dashclock is running  it disables the swipe down to show notifications. When I first discovered this bug I thought it was my phone... but the problem only occurs when Dashclock is activated during charge....,0,1,1,1,8255
I have been using Book Catalogue for a long time and I am very impressed. I have tried several Apps for cataloging my books and this App is the only one that has everything I need and much much more. It makes it very easy to keep track of the dates I begin and finish a book  I love the cover photos and also being able to sync with Goodreads. I really like that I am able to search for books with the Author Name and the Name of the book  or a few other options for adding books. There are many options to customize fields so you can see all information desired about a Book  Author  ISBN  Series  Publisher  Reading Dates  Ratings  Notes and more. I also love that I am able to look up a book by the ASIN. I am almost always able to find each book I search for. Keeping track of my Library has never been easier. There is the Name of the Book  It has the Author Name  ISBN  Page count  type of Book(paperback  Hardcover  Audiobook  etc...)Bookshelves  Notes  Reading Dates  Location of the Book  the Description and more. I am very happy to have found such a useful App  I use this App Several times a Day.,0,0,1,1,158579
I used the app to search for names in a directory with 20 text files (from 247KB up to 3927KB). The search uses regular expressions and ignores case. This app can really search for what I need to look for in the document. On my mobile phone (2 Cores 1.2GHz)  the search process takes about 30 seconds  maybe up to 40 seconds to check the result for all the files. The same search process takes about 15 to 20 seconds On a tablet pc (4 Cores 1.3GHz). My default document viewer is having trouble opening these moderately big sized txt files but with aGrep  opening and viewing the text within the search results is amazingly fast. It is also easy to cancel the searching so you can quickly change the search parameters if you made a mistake on your input. (Doing all this search process on a mainstream desktop PC will display the results instantaneously) I don't know if it is about my Phone's processing power that the search result takes some time. From the apps that I have tried out so far  this is the only one that can do the task. Now  I'm just checking if there are other apps that can do it faster.,0,0,1,1,2456
"I have never reviewed an app before today but due to the massive inconvenience this app has caused me I felt it was only fair to warn other's about this update.

I've tried EVERYTHING to fix this  every single method I've found online  I spent an hour and a half on the phone yesterday with my phone carrier's tech support while they tried sending a few updates and fixes remotely to my phone  but nothing worked.

Incredible app .. allows me to run all my essential linux console programs on my tablet or phone  with or without external bluetooth keyboard. Eg: Emacs/tramp editing over VPN; full access/editing of my encrypted org-mode files (synced with dropbox/dropsync); monitoring phone's resources with htop. And  if I'm at someone else's computer and need access to my stuff  I can just ssh into my phone and enjoy the convenience of big screen/keyboard/mouse with my portable server! :-) Yeah  it's slower than a desktop  but surprisingly usable. Before this  I had thought seriously about loading ubuntu onto my tablet to get this type of portable linux environment  but honestly  termux gives me pretty much everything I need (console-based for now)  plus android .. best of both worlds! Just when I'm already blown away  I find other really stuff in the well-written docs: multiple-sessions  keyboard enhancements (such as: press volume down to simulator ctrl)  termux-api (send/read SMS  text-to-speech etc.) ... just incredible.

5 Stars It's better than a 4 so I give it a 5. I just discovered Lucid and gave it a Test Drive on both my phone and a large tablet like HP Slate. I have tested a bunch of different browsers and this is the first one that works out really great on both devices. Some of the web pages load up a little nicer in desktop mode on my HP than it does using my other go to browser(Dolphin). I can get the fonts big enough using Lucid so a legally blind person could read. User interface  customization  ease of use  etc. is all quite to my liking so far. I will probably be a buyer for the ad free version of this browser. I just did an additional comparison to the Dolphin browser I was using for a few weeks... I played back video on Universal Sports.... Lucid browser played the video smooth and flawless while the Dolphin browser was playing back slowly  stalled and crashed once. My impressions are that this is the better browser. Facebook is a little buggy with the Lucid browser- having trouble clicking to chat and new comments in the top menu bar... that would be the only fault I have found so far.,1,1,1,1,119785
Great but has a playback bug that really annoys me I love the features on this player  but there is one bug that annoys the heck out of me. Many times  when I skip to the next track on the playlist  there is no music playing even though the progress bar and time is moving along. The only way to get it playing is to press the pause button and then press play again. This happens in offline mode as well as online mode. It didn't always do this before  so I don't know what happened. I've used this player for well over a year  but this problem just started like a month or two ago. *update*: I did try reinstalling Dsub  but after reinstalling  i found that it remembered all of my settings. I found that the playback problem seems to be related to my bluetooth speaker (UE Boom). When i use dsub w/o the bluetooth speaker  everything seems to behaves normally. Very strange problem. Possibly the player stops sending signals to the speaker in between song skips and it has trouble reinitiating when the next song starts? I can hear slight clicky sounds on the bluetooth speaker when skipping tracks.,1,1,1,1,173432

Google play service has not work. Tried all the trick. Enentually reset. I did &gt;20 times. Still not work. That leaves rooting. I decide not to Dr o. If reset is not working  roting may not help. Cant save n retrieved game. YouTube not working. I download to factory version. That works. Not really  many clips are not supported. The one that supported  the clip keep skipping. Google want us to use play service  so it can collect our data. Fine  the app n YouTube r free. Of course  uber wants us to play. Not going to do it if google refuses. I search internet. The prob start at least 2 yr ago. According one article  despite &gt; 800k ppl complain  google is not going. My advice do not download.

Tell Google what I think  well I'm not a great fan of Android due to incompatibility with this system .updates from any apps can cause problems  meaning an app might work on one device but not on another. You buy an app (but not anymore for me) then it gets an update and it does not work. I had a problem with the wifi icon greyed (wifi still worked even though grey means not connected) out rather than have a blue icon past several months. Googled the problem but not much luck with the solution. I deleted all the updates still no luck then deleted a piece of software called GOOGLE SETTINGS connected to GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES which was a previous update. By doing this it brought back the familier blue wifi icon to let you know you are connected. Unfortunately the latest update of Gmail crashes too on android so have rolled back to the factory version. I've been a great fan of Google for decades since they came on the scene  but Android versions does not cut it for me PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES. Sorry to say if I can give no stars I would  so my score for this software 0/5.,0,1,1,1,240833
"5Stars and highest donation 1) I don't only contact developers when having a problem or a request with an application  I also do so when being seriously impressed  which are the case with your """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""ClipStack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" application. This was obvious for acknowledgement after only 5 mins for my part. 2) You offer all functions in the free version  3) You ask for donation  but only to support you  not to unlock extra features  as they are already available in the free version. 4) The application does NOT take a lot of memory = it's a small size.  5) Simply  you have made a very nice looking interface and very easy to access from the drop-down menu at the top of screen. THANK YOU. In my head it yields: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Make it work  but keep it simple""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  which is exactly what you did.  I find these reasons to be VERY high and humble service. Hence I donated the highest possible amount you've made available.

Very impressive browser and I love the ad blocker. At first I thought it wasn't working after I turned it on and then I realized I needed to restart the browser. When I did - ads were blocked. Everything works much faster with the ad blocker on - and even without  it seems as fast as Chrome on Android. I give this a 4 star rating because there are some issues: 1. Importing bookmarks from Chrome does not work at all. I tried this on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone and my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 and got the same results. 2. There's a strange thing that happens with the screen when rotating from landscape to portrait orientation. The height of the browser window doesn't go to the bottom of the screen. Refreshing the page does not solve the problem  but tapping the control on the phone/tablet to see all open apps - and then going right back into Lightning does solve the problem. Seems like a bit of a bug - which is easy to reproduce every time and on both my android devices. Other than these issues  I think it's worth every penny of the $1.50 for the ad blocking version.,0,1,1,1,130824

Great app! I have been using this app for a while and have saved over 700 books with it. I'm an avid reader  and I use Kindle Unlimited to borrow books to read. If you buy a book from Amazon you can later see if you've read it  but if you borrow one with the Unlimited program and then return it there is no way too see if you've previously borrowed or read a book. It was always a problem remembering which books I had already read. With this app I can keep track of the books I have previously borrowed. I can keep a personal review of each book. It is easy to put the books info into the app by using the ISBN or ASIN number  or you can do an Internet search for the book or enter it manually. You can expand or collapse the list of books making the list quicker to navigate. The app occasionally reminds me to do a back up so I don't lose all that info  and the backups are easy to do. I use this app everyday  and would highly recommend it. It not only lists which books I have previously read  but I can look to see whether I liked the book or the author. Wonderful tool.,0,1,0,1,158963

QKSMS is an excellently designed app  with an attractive interface and a good feature list  all adorned with the benefit of being open-source! Unfortunately  my experience has failed to live up to my hopes  not because of its design  but because of its performance. QKSMS's interface seems to be very laggy and unstable. It will frequently hang for several seconds  or become confused and take me where I wasn't expecting to go. I often have to set my phone down for a few seconds to let the app sort itself out  before I try and navigate back to where I actually wanted to be. It will occasionally close the keyboard without obvious cause  or boot me back to the conversation list while typing a message. Additionally  it doesn't seem to have good MMS support; all of my MMS messages have timestamps from 1970 in the conversation view and all appear at the bottom - despite the fact that long-pressing an MMS message gives a perfectly fine timestamp. I'd love to love QKSMS  but it doesn't seem to love me back. It would be my daily driver if not for the sad bugginess.,1,1,0,1,158296
Originally used to replace widget on Samsung S series phone when built in widget disappeared. Had difficulty at first since when installing only downloads settings icon but not widget itself. Fooled around with it and suddenly the widget started working on phone. It's a great widget working so well on phone I decided to add it to my Samsung Note Tablet 10. Same issue as before. Installed settings icon but no calendar widget even though settings are set to my default calendar. I can't recall how I got widget itself to appear on phone and I'm hardly a mobile device illiterate. Something is wrong when you create an app that doesn't make obvious how to activate full widget. Uninstalled. Waste of space unless you know how to unlock the magic key to get widget itself to appear on screen. Fortunately old widget still working on tablet although it's not as good as one on phone. Going to get new phone soon and wonder what will happen if I try to install this on new device. Useless without widget! Surely I'm not the only one with this issue and nothing on Github.,0,1,1,1,32433
I love the game and all of its mechanics! I have some requests though it may just be because I suck: 1) I think more balancing is needed regarding the chances of what kind of glyph you will get from an arcane stylus. I just get the ones that root or slow the player too often. 2) Vampire bats seem to take rather high amount of health from me and seem to dodge too well too. I don't know  it seems unfair and gets on my nerves. 3) The sniper doesn't have nearly as many advantages compared to the warden  and the assassin to the freerunner. 4) Health potions and food are rarer to come upon. Especially approaching boss level depths. 5) I think access to rings need to be improved. I have frequent games where I do not come across an artefact or other item to fill my other 2 equip slots. And the variety of ring functionality can really change one game from another  if only they weren't so rare. 6) Please nerf the skeleton blasts  in most cases there aren't any means to kill them at a distance and their blasts are rather high for a low level player in my opinion.,1,0,0,1,172849
Great App But Have One Suggestion This is a great app. It annoys me that whenever my phone pairs with my car  it automatically starts playing my music. Sometimes the songs that play are ones that I downloaded for my daughter and even she is embarrassed about them as well. This app lets you determine which apps should playback instead. My suggestion is as follows  and I know this can be accomplished with Tasker but I feel this is way easier to use for Joe Schmo. Please allow the user to designate which app should launch. For example  I use Serius XM to listen to Howard Stern during my drive. It would be awesome if I could get Sirius XM app to launch via Media Button Router. Unfortunately  the Sirius XM app is not recognized as a media playback app so I cannot designate it in the Media Button Router UI. If you allow the user to designate which app they wish to launch  that would be a great advantage for people using apps that are also not recognized as media playback apps. Again  great app. It is a must for anyone wanting full control on their phone.,1,0,1,1,12354

"I used to use this when I had an old Linux version on my PC that did not support MTP for my phone and it worked great for connecting to Linux or a NetBSD shell account I have on the Internet  etc. But since I upgraded from a Samsung S3 to J7 this app does not even appear to have any way to allow me to add my ssh key that I need to use to connect to my Linux desktop PC or anything else (I normally disallow passwords in Linux to require keys only). When I try to """"""""""""""""Manage Pubkeys"""""""""""""""" it says 'Tap""""""""""""""""Menu"""""""""""""""" button to create or import key pairs'  but where in the world is a """"""""""""""""Menu"""""""""""""""" button on an Android (6.0.1) phone? When I try More > Import  it says """"""""""""""""Pick from /sdcard""""""""""""""""  but the only choice is """"""""""""""""Cancel"""""""""""""""". So it used to work great  but is now totally useless for anyone who wants or needs to use keys instead of passwords  since there is no way to select a key file from internal storage or microSD (sdcard).

"This app is easy to use and I love it. It may be a bit hard to understand at first  but once you learn it  you can be as productive as possible. I've seen other KeePass apps that open databases  some that come with custom keyboards that you use a button to type a password in. I don't like that  because I have a hardware keyboard on my tablet  and I'd like not to waste screen space with an on-screen keyboard. This app takes an approach I've not seen; when you leave the app on an entry  it puts """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Copy password"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Copy username"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" notifications  so it even works with apps besides browsers! I personally see this as a genius idea and I love the app. Especially since I use the app OneDriveSync  this makes the transition between PC and tablet seamless. Only one problem I see: you can't set an icon for an entry or group. Or at least  I haven't figured it out yet. I was very happy to see that it displayed icons and this is  again  a feature that most apps lack. Great app overall  I love it.""""",1,1,0,1,115688

"Does not work with several popular comment subscription plugins.

It's mostly good  but has a significantly annoying error which lets it down It works  until I change a setting in the phone's OS interface manually  then it stops working until I restart the app. So for example  let's say I have it set to go silent at 10pm and for the sound to turn back on at 8am. Well  sometimes there will be an exceptional exception (i.e. not one I can program into Timeriffic)  and I will just want to turn it silent for a little bit (using the OS interface) or vice versa  expecting Timeriffic to continue setting the settings as instructed at the scheduled times -- e.g. I might silence it at 9am  and then unsilence it at 10am  expecting it to silence again at 10pm -- but instead it just stops doing it at all  even though the app says it's still enabled. If this error can be fixed  I will donate to the Timeriffic developer/s  but only if they will accept Bitcoin. I don't like registering all my details with third party payment providers  connecting them to my bank account  and giving them a cut of every transaction.,0,1,1,1,16156

Amazing game I have had this game on three different devices and played it for almost two years. I have beaten it with the Warrior  the Mage  and the Rogue. Working on the Huntress currently. Yes  the game is hard but once you have a good strategy you will have farther runs each time. Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low  or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level  and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise. Stand in water while fighting to wash away his caustic ooze and use an earth root for added protection. Good luck!!,0,0,1,1,41759
The Best I've played chess since 2nd grade so its a passion. I have at least 6 other chess apps on my tablet  and this is the only one I use every day. My only real issue with the app is the strength setting is in terms of percentage and not ELO  ELO numbers  mean a lot to a chess player; and to have the strength of the opponent as a meaningless 5 10  50%- of what? Its well below the standard of this app. The GUI is excellent  and Stockfish is of course one the best Engines. I would prefer Delphi or another engine that better simulates human club players for the 2nd Engine. The Presentation  the smoothness of the movement; good rich intuitive menus. Easily moving from Human v Human to Human v Machine allows me to practice against favored openings and key positions. The computer v Computer play allows me to see a position played out by opponents that are a little better than myself or lightyears better. I said  I love chess  I reach for this app everyday. I really think the devs got this one right: but it could be even better!,1,1,0,1,101008
Great app so far. Working nicely and exactly for what I sought. Was planning to write an app myself for this purpose until i found this. However  some minor issues which I found so far: - I did not get the email function to work with my Gmail address.. I used gmail's smtp server adress and it could validate the SSL certificate just fine. When trying to send the data it gives an error though. I'm not using this function in the long run but thought I'd try it out once for testing purposes. - When selecting 'log to plain text' to log to a .csv file  the app actually logs to a .txt file which cannot be opened in a simple text editor  but when opening it in microsoft Excel it shows the data just fine. There is even more data then in the .gpx and .kml file format variants. So i'd like to use this dataset but then as an plain .csv text file rather then it presumably being a .xlsx file. - When annotating a point  the resulting .kml file is broken: the first '<name>' tag is closed as '</na' which can be fixed by adding 'me>' manually.,1,1,0,1,285411
"I wanted to inform you that I will be uninstalling your app and ceasing listening to any of your programming. It has become apparent since the outcome of the most recent election that NPR and its affiliates are more interested in opinions than news. More and more of your coverage is anti-Trump and pro-bias. You can be informational without being opinionated. I just read an article that repeatedly said Trump """"crowed"""" instead of """"said"""". It happened over and over. That is unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing to the content being presented  other than the apparent and publicized view of the writer. The combination of the polarized coverage  the large increase in typos/grammatical errors/incoherent sentences  and the decrease in professionalism in word and phrasing choice is more than enough to show that unbiased reporting is no longer a priority to you. Because of this  I will be taking my leave from your programming and I will continue informing/discussing this disturbing loss of NPR's ethics with my friends and family.",0,1,0,0,163350

on an android? I've used PasswordSafe (PWS) for several years on the PC. It works as advertised  and I'm very happy with it. However  I've never been able to use it successfully on my HTC ONE-X Android. If I bring up an app to log into  then bring up PWS  I have to copy the user id for the site  then go back to the app and paste it in  then go back to PWS  copy the pw  then go back to the app and paste it in. This is to much navigation on a mobile to make it worthwhile. I can rarely maintain context in the app in order to paste in the 2 fields. What is needed is some way to copy all credentials for a site without having to leave the site and go into PWS. I've not found any help on-line as to how to do this differently. 12/16/2014 -- after reading Jeff's reply  I did finally see how to change the input method. It is not very reliable on the HTC One  but that is certainly not a problem with PWS. When HTC allows it  the PWS input method is great  very easy to use. With that out of the way  I gotta go with 5 stars. Thx Jeff!!,0,1,1,1,132286
Ok so now my app keep crashing/force closing. I did a factory reset  that didn't work  I downloaded the latest NEXUS 5X BULLHEAD OTA IMAGE from the ANdroid Developers website and installed it via ADB. It's working now but I lost all my data and still sometimes I get a Force Close Message. I've never rooted or modified my phone in anyway that could void my warranty on my Nexus 5X. I had to downgrade my Google Play Services App by downloading an earlier version of it from apkmirror to get my phone to work and open apps but it's still not at %100 working stability. Nexus 5X and 6P are supposed to be the last two Nexus phones that are still getting support even though the Pixel Line was made to phase out the Nexus line. That's fine  but when I end up buying the Pixel or Pixel 2  If I still have this same problem  I'm returning the phone and buying an iPhone as much as it pains me. I've been using ANdroid ever since Froyo! I use pretty much all your google services. Shouldn't that count for something? So disappointed! -__-,1,1,0,0,237491
"This app works great on supported devices. I am appalled by some of the reviewers here  rating this great app poorly because of their own ignorance and stupidity. If the value is in the ~500000mAh area  first of all its what is reported by your device(!!)  secondly you can normalize this value in the settings! On my Note 2 this app gives the exact charging current from 500mA using a 500mA charger to 1800mA using a 2.1A charger on the stock kernel or 2000+ mA with modded charging current settings. On my Nexus 10 the app displays the current flow into and out of the battery (supplied by the adapter-used by the device). The app not being able to show charging current only is because of a limitation in the Maxim DS2784 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""fuel gauge"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" IC used by Samsung in the N10. It's not because of CurrentWidget and it's nothing that can be done software-wise. And if CurrentWidget is not showing what you would like it to show  start by contacting the developer  don't write bullshit in the review section.""""",0,0,1,1,888
CycleStreets LiveRide has the edge over Google's turn by turn Navigation Yesterday I cycled 20 miles just north of London on back roads listening to voice navigation delivered by bluetooth headset (bluedio EH) and not looking at the screen. The main differences I see between CycleStreets and Google are 1) CycleSteets provides the name of each street  not the road number which is helpful on small back roads which are named but not numbered 2) CycleStreets tells you when you are off route and when to turn around  Google seems to just replan the route silently (and that requires a permanent wireless connection) 3) CycleStreets confirms all 'straight ons' at junctions. Bascially CycleStreets talks to you more often and gives you more confidence that you are on the right route. As an aside turn by turn navigation requires GPS to be on all the time which uses loads of power. So I don't use CycleStreets on my phone. I run the CycleStreets on a tablet tossed into my pannier which can provide many hours of GPS navigation.,0,0,0,0,165134
To other Reviewers  please don‚Äôt denigrate this terrific App by deducting Stars for missing features  or features that don‚Äôt work right with YOUR particular Smartphone & OS  ...

"Fantastic  just great. SOLID 5 stars Running this on my new Nexus 6  and used it to identify a number of things that were eating up the battery. Now  my battery use during a normal work day is about 1.5% per hour. It's higher at evenings & weekends (when I am """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""playing"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" on the phone) but even then  it's not bad. I also have it on my older Nexus 7 tablet. True story...I noticed that the tablet seemed to be losing charge rather quickly. Used BBS to set a custom reference point  then left the tablet with screen off overnight (that is  it was not being used at all). Next morning I saw that the tablet was getting ZERO """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""deep sleep""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  and about 90% of the time it was active  at 51MHz. So then I used BBS to investigate - found & corrected the problem (for some reason  it was trying to connect to a cellular carrier  even though the tablet has no cellular radio!!) -- now the unused tablet is in deep sleep about 92% of the time  and battery drain is VERY slow!!""""",0,1,1,1,26220
Useful  but the Android and PC Desktop versions of this software are missing many of the useful editing features available to iPhone/Apple users. You can waste a lot of time watching tutorials  hoping that they will get around to mentioning the existence of Android or PC or showing the non-Apple/iPhone interfaces (spoiler: they don't). And you can waste a lot of time trying to find the missing features you saw in the tutorials  (spoiler: they are not there). Finally  you can search their manual and supporting documentation for some sort of acknowledgement that these features are missing form the Android/PC versions of the software  so you can allow yourself to stop searching in vain and go to bed  but this search will be fruitless too. So  if you want an intelligent program training you on flashcards using spaced repetition  and you don't mind that you can do only the most nominal of editing of the cards themselves  this one is for you. But don't expect greatness  or supporting materials for non Apple users.,1,0,0,1,97666
Sony Xperia Active with Android 4.04. Tiny  free and add free application that does exactly what it is supposed to do. Basically  it is as if the application types for you in the browser address bar the path of the HTML file saved in your device internal storage when you open this file from your file manager. Tried from Total Commander with success. Therefore the result will depend on the browser that you select  and not on this application. Will not work with Opera Mini as Opera Mini loads from Opera servers the pages after optimization by Opera servers: Opera Mini cannot open HTML files saved on internal storage. You can select the default browser that will open the file  or you can make the application display all the available browsers for you to choose. You can donate if you want but it is not mandatory. On Motorola Defy+ with Android 2.3  and ES File Explorer this application is not necessary  the HTML file will open in the default browser when launched from ES File Explorer.

Orig 2/13/2016: Was a nice little application to practice words while waiting in line at the store. That was until all my decks just disappeared. Now  why would I want to use the application without anything to practice?! Update 2/14/2016 I thought that this was caused by a automatic update to a version that forced a logging into the site to use any features. Or at least all that was prompted for was to login to the site  and the decks showed zero. I had built a few decks. I feel that maybe for an Open Source project still alive  I judged to harshly after my initial shock. I'm still going to have to dig through old storage backups for any possible files. I already deleted the application on the phone. 5/3/2016 I was able to remove the /storage/sdcard0/AnkiDroid/ folder. Install the Application again. Next  I restored the last copy of the folder before the card sets disappeared. Then started the application and the cards all showed-up again. I'm happy that I had the backup and that it was that simple.,1,0,1,0,97868

Fabulous Simplicity Well  I'm certainly not an expert on Android but contrary to one of the reviews here of flash being a no goer then as I live on Youtube I have to say I have no issues whatsoever with Tint browser Flash on Galaxy Ace 3 (4.2) merely by installing the last android adobe flash 4.0 and this trendy little browser plays Youtube videos perfectly along with in webpage vids too. The UI is truly stylish and is easy to navigate  no rotten adverts  many different settings and it 'IS' open source and although it's not the best browser I have I'm giving it 5 stars because I've had no issues at all with it (unlike many other brands) and in all reality I think some users expect above and beyond expectations for totally free softwares  some don't read the instructions on the lid and some don't have the specs to support some softwares (imho) There are ALWAYS room for improvements with anything but I'm not complaining here at all.

Love Hate Relationship I love NPR and listen to it throughout the day  but this app makes me feel like a masochist. I never know if it's going to work or not  but I keep using it on the off chance it does load right. I can add shows to my queue but whether or not it actually loads right is a gamble. Sometimes I load things  give up  and a couple hours later it starts to play out of the blue (really nice when I'm in situations like a work meeting  and my phone starts blaring) I'm giving it 2 stars because when it works  it's so nice (I can listen to entire programs  which I like since I have a few I like to listen start to finish  like Morning Edition) but honestly NPR - with the constant reviews and complaints about how buggy this app is  you really need to get it together and fix it. I've been using the NPR app for years now  and the revamp they did about 1.5 years ago ruined it. It'd be better if they just rolled it back to the older app than having people constantly battle the current one.,0,1,1,1,163133

Through a series of event of phone crash and non working OISafe  I discovered this website and read Ulrik Lauren's post and WOW!  It worked for me too. I had almost given up regaining my passwords through OISafe but just couldn't find any other password app that I liked or trusted like OISafe. I am so thankful you posted this help. Before going to the Application Manager and selecting permissions for storage in the OISafe app  I copied the two files  oisafe.csv and oisafe. xml to the root directory of the sdcard and the phone. I also put it in the downloads folder. I deleted the app itself and reinstalled it. The app said it found the import file ( it had done that before but never resulted in anything--- before the remedy of in the application manager-- and Woop  there it was  all of my data. Bottom line this is a great and simple password app and there is nothing else like it out there. I hope they do indeed have an upgrade in the near future as I was told in an email from them.,1,1,0,1,65578

"Excellent subsonic app A.very good subsonic client - easy to use  good layout  reliable. My only gripe is the lack of support for multiple tags in the same field  i.e. tags separated by some separator  for example """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""jazz;free jazz;experimental"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as the genre tag  which should result in the song being found under all of the three genres listed  or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sunn O)));Boris"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as the artist field  which should result in the song (and the whole album of the song) being listed under both the artists """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sunn O)))"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Boris"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".

Why doesn't the desktop Telegram have the same updated emojis as the mobile app emojis?? And god i would be so so grateful if you could introduce video calling  voice calling  and two possibilities.. Walkie Talkie  and also voice & video messaging  for example  sending them a pre-recorded video of something that you wanted to say to them or tell them  but you and your friend are never able to do it together at the same time  say because of time zone differences  because they work different hours  days  etc. So if it had the option to send pre-recorded voice calls  video calls  so that when you or your friend are able to have that option to watch the voice & video calls that you both wanted to have  but still have the option of listening & watching each others video & voice calls when it is convenient for both of you at what ever time you want  and also have the option for them to have a expire date & that you are able to download on to your phone  if you choose to do so.,1,0,1,0,147166
This app is amazing! I've switched from Samsung to LG (2nd Galaxy phone died just weeks after warranty ran out :-( I had SMS & MMS backed up to my Samsung account but LG won't access it! Did a search  found this app. Was able to use my friend's Samsung Galaxy SIII to connect to my Samsung account and restore my texts. Then use SMS Backup+ to backup the texts to my gmail account....took awhile  about an hour (3800 SMS & about 750 MMS). The App creates a folder in gmail called 'SMS' and you can view/read all your texts there...but that's not the end! I also installed SMS Backup+ on my LG and backed up all the new texts (about 2 months worth  200 texts) to my gmail - and the app appended older texts from the same contact with the new texts (wow!!). Then went back to my LG and did a 'restore' (follow the simple directions) and voila! All my texts are in my LG phone (back to 2014) with the new ones combined with older ones - sweet! I'm impressed  thank you Jan Berkel :-) <3,0,0,0,0,23354
It's good  but needs to let the user know what's going on I'm very happy to have Zandy  and it does work. I'd give it 5 stars  except for: -What's going on when it's syncing? It pops up a little box  briefly  when syncing starts  and then when it's over. But I'd rather not sit there waiting for it. Zandy doesn't seem to handle the WiFi arrow very well  so that's a very unreliable way to tell if Zandy is busy or not. -Attachment downloading confusion: Zandy seems to start downloading another copy of an attachment when my tablet (Lenovo S6000) dims the screen  when I go to another app  or just kind of at random. There will be multiple download message boxes for the same item alternating with each other. Again  it's impossible to figure out what's going on. -Won't see attachments without parent items: This is just kind of annoying  but as far as I can tell if you have a file -- PDF  say -- that you've put in Zotero without yet creating a parent item  Zandy can't find it.,0,0,1,1,14465
Used to work great doesn't work on S4 anymore Now it launches and all I hear is the dreamcast boot up sound and no video. Then it just sits on a black screen and the phone gets hot like the cpu is overworking in a loop. Please fix this used to be the best emulator on my phone Update: I messed around with a a long time yesterday after I updated to the kitkat 4.4 on my S4. I finally got it working when I saw it saying that my MOGA pivot app crashed after I launched the emulator and it hung. It used to work with it installed no problem until the lasted update to reicast  but I guess the older version of android wasn't showing the error about moga pivot. This Moga pivot is what i use to play with a game MOGA game controller. I have not tried re-installing MOGA pivot yet so when I do  I will update this again if it still works after installing it back on the phone. The controller is what made it fun  I really hate touch screen for games that were designed for a controller,0,1,0,1,5102
Nice. Works great for the most part. I love the no-lag connection when using my PC keyboard to type in WhatsApp and the stock SMS app. The one drawback is navigation functionality  which could use some work... For example  I can use CTRL+Q to back out of a WhatsApp conversation  and then I can use up/down arrows to move around my current conversations  but there is no way to actually enter into a different conversation! With my stock SMS app  on the other hand  I can select a conversation from my list of current conversations and enter into any one with my keyboard ENTER key; i can then back out of that conversation using CTRL+Q  but at that point I'm completely frozen! Up/down doesn't work anymore  CTRL+Q doesn't work anymore...so I'm forced to pick up the phone again. Still the best remote keyboard app I've ever seen  though (: (I think step-by-step installation instructions would be helpful to those who have no experience using a telnet connection  by the way.),1,0,0,1,110522
YOU GUYS ROCK!!! For years now... After having developed my own system for tracking routines  habits  projects  planning  etc  on a paper planner (and was learning how to make an app exclusively for my system)  I come across this AWESOME App. I have no need to look any further. THIS APP IS PERFECT FOR MY SYSTEM!!! I look forward to any and all upgrades coming. Now for a few ideas that immediately popped in my brain... LoL I WOULD TRIPLE LOVE IT IF... #1) There could be the possibility to have a computer software to sync with LoopHabitTracker for faster input. I WOULD QUADRUPLE LOVE IT IF... #2) I could have the ability to categorize the/a list and open a different tab for different lists  when working on specific projects  routines  etc that I may want to expand/itemize. (ex. Cleaning Routine  Homestead Gardening Routine & Animals Care  Once a Month tasks  Braking a Bad Habit  etc) Again  You guys ROCK! Thank You So Much For Sharing This APP.

Mobile phones are awful to use. Presenting the user with 100 icons to scroll through is designer laziness. This app throws all that out. You want to run WhatsApp  swipe 'whatsapp' and bang it's open. Want to open a browser  swipe 'browser' and it's there. This launcher is also blindingly fast. I love it. Great work! As I am a moon-on-a-stick kinds guy  features I would love to see: * the settings.txt file works on a Linux desktop  but not a phone. This really needs even a minimal interface; with help/hints on what the settings do * When guessing the appname  sometimes a space is swiped in and it autocorrelation 'w whatsapp' which of course does not load WhatsApps. Can single unknown token before an appname be ignored? * 'alias m=AquaMail'; I want to be able to create (and 'unset') aliases in the UI * 'apps | grep foobar'; does a fuzzy string/description search * Some appnames should be hidden ('AquaMail unlocker') and other launchers honour those settings,1,0,0,1,71606
I wanted to like it but there were simply too many issues. 1) I was unable to connect any academic accounts . Set-up was a breeze with my gmail accounts but anything with a .edu at the end refused to authenticate. I noticed that others have had issues connecting to exchange accounts but the support responses were always requests for endless additional bits of information with no answers. Generally  I'm willing to screw around with log-in issues like this for a very short time before gettiing irritated...especially when I know the log-in info is correct. This alone was enough to ditch the app. 2) the layout is uninspiring at best. The back button (to return to the list of accounts) is tiny and up in the corner of the phone and was very difficult to hit without triggering the phones drop-down menu. The big arrow that I constantly mistook for the back button just takes you to the next email. The search continues for an alternative mail app that works for me!,1,1,0,1,278850
Smooth  polished  and the text-chat interface concept is a brilliant idea that is very well implemented here. I grew up in the 1980s playing these Infocom titles  and while I go back to them every so often as an adult  I've yet to get that same feel from mobile Z-machines (such as Son of Hunky Punk  which otherwise is also good). The chat-text interface here is the perfect transition to modern mobile platforms for these games  and I'm frankly amazed that no one had thought of it before. As others have mentioned here  the only real point of frustration I have is the lack of .z4 support  which eliminates later classic Infocom titles such as A Mind Forever Voyaging. But for about 70-80% of Infocoms and virtually anything produced in the Inform era (post-1997 or so)  this Z interpreter is just spot on. I'm giving this five stars  because it deserves it  even without .z4 support. With .z4 support  I'd be petitioning Google to make a six-star rating possible.,0,0,1,1,15673
"Awesome game!!!! Well written  engaging and unique stories. Many quests  not all require hack 'n' slash (which is realistic) and the story outcome truly depends upon the choices you make. The game is free because its an """"in our spare time"""" project  which is the real reason updates have been a long wait. But there ARE updates coming up  the next one is being tested now. One review reads  """"I wish there was a D-pad"""" obviously that guy didn't check his player options! Adding sound would take up memory that the dev team would rather use for more story elements  items  towns and quests. Sprites are all free license and the game is available in multiple languages. Some new players have gotten involved with development  so there will be original sprites in the future (I'm guessing... since at least 4 of the new people are artists). Plus the AT forum community is the best there is and quite helpful! Get it  keep it  and get into the forum to stay informed!",1,0,0,0,3546

Solid early release with good capabilities. Syncs flawlessly with taskd server even with heavy-duty encryption settings (SECURE256:+TLS-VER1.2) on Android 6.x Interface would benefit from the following: - Allow the user to customize which reports show up in the toolbar - there are too many and most Taskwarrior power users gravitate to only a few reports (ls  ready  blocked  blocking) - Create a drop-down to enable / disable each tag thereby filtering the results of each report. This could be done via the taskwarrior context command. - Create a drop-down to filter results by project - Place the project and tag fields on the same row in the report viewer to reduce the number of lines used in the display. - Allow the user to override the system default font size to select smaller / larger text in the report viewer. - Fully populate all the fields in the dialog box that pops up when the user taps on the project or tag of a task in the report viewer.,1,0,0,1,72580
battery drain  lag I have the same problem as others. I have used this app ever since i bout my phone (over 8 months ago) and recently my contacts app is slow to load and will only load 30 contacts. But give it about a whole minute and the rest will load. Messaging app will only show phone numbers and not the contact name. But give it a whole minute and it will. And the phone call log is slow as well. Battery drain problem as well. Android Core Apps is what it says is draining it now. Cleared cache... did nothing. Factory reset my phone.... did nothing. Updated my phone... did nothing. Finally Samsung had me put the phone in safe mode which keeps only the pre-loaded apps on it running. It works fine. Which tells me it is a problem with a downloaded app. This app is the only app i have that deals with the contacts and i will be deleting it to see if that solves my problem. I am betting it does. Too bad.... this was a great app while it lasted.,0,1,0,1,112310
I've spent too much time on pretty much every big name launcher with extreme levels of customization  it's time something like Shell Launcher came around. I was still a kid the last time I messed with terminal interfaces  so my way around a new Android-powered terminal shell is a bit rusty. Anyways  despite the simplicity this launcher hits three essentials for me: Simplicity  I don't need a bunch of screens or widgets to play with  or to make sure they still work hours later. Fluidity  no garish or mismatched styles bogging down responsiveness  something my phones out-of-the-box interface suffers from. Versatility  both simplicity WITH versatility is something I don't find with Nova anymore... In my honest *opinion* Once I got the hang of it again I felt like I was using a different OS in the best way possible  so bravo to Francesco for Shell UI... A couple problems I ran into: Music player crashes >>t-ui  clearing also tends to overwhelm.,0,1,0,1,71453
Generally it's good. However I'd like there to be an option for entering a word as whole  before you 'enter' it officially. There are many times where I get dinged from having a perfect puzzle because I knew the correct answer  but typed a wrong letter. Usually this is because of the smaller keyboard; my finger hit the letter next to the one I intended to use. Of course  using this whole-word option would mean all boxes may be wrong if you're wrong  and that's fine. In addition  sometimes it enters a letter twice  like a keyboard glitch or something. This doesn't happen often  but enough that this reason also prohibits me from having a perfect puzzle. On a rare occasion the second unintended may be correct  but generally it isn't. Also  once a correct letter is entered  it'd be nice if it couldn't be erased or backspaced over for those times when I have no idea what the word is and have to 'brute force' letters to get the correct answer.,1,0,0,1,121049
The mobile chess interface and game to use in android. Droifish is robust  has extensive PGN & analysis support  and has useful features. I find myself converting many .cbh files to pgn in Chessbase and using them in Droidfish for study and analysis. Obviously this app is not for the casual player. Although you can add more unessential features such as kibitzer etc. (a la Chessbase)  what makes the Droidfish highly efficient is that the developer has thoughtfully chosen the most productive features for a mobile implementation. It will no doubt continue to get better due to the dedication and the developer's desire to provide us with a high quality mobile chess game that-unfairly-does not even ask us for donation. I for one  very much appreciate his work. I can play  study analyze productively. Considering that eye catching graphics do not have anything to do with chess  it is simply the most complete chess game for android. Fantastic!,1,0,0,0,101082
Had to try codes over 20 times to even set up the google authenticator account Its an interesting idea to keep accounts safe but it doesn't work properly. I had to enter a code to set up my google authenticator account over 20 freaking times and it just wouldn't take the code  and when these codes are timed  it gets overly frustraiting and stupid. I tried each and every code with a a space too since it wasn't accepting the codes without one either. It FINALLY decided to work after 10-15 minutes of trying and alot of anger and frustration. So like I said  its an interesting idea for account security...... WHEN IT DECIDES TO WORK! Hopefully  you fix this problem before I'm forced to use this app for verification purposes again cause if it pisses me off like it did the first time  its bye bye app and hello new app that actually works properly! NOT IMPRESSED OR HAPPY ABOUT THAT. At this point  I would NOT recommend this app to my friends.,1,1,0,1,281726
The Google Play Store app is not among the apps inside Google Play app itself.. making it impossible to right a review on the Google Play app itself!!!! I think the Google Play app in order to distinguish itself from the competition which is becoming better and better must include more possibilities for the user to search for apps to buy or freely install: 1) possibility to search only apps that are free 2) possibility to filter out apps that require specific permissions 3) obviously the possibility to search for apps that do not require any special permission 4) possibility to arrange results in order of proce  number of required permissions  name  and so on You must give more power to the user... the user must not feel limited in power as is the case now!!! This is very important.. if you havn't thought about it yet then it is time to do so.. if you have and not applied these changes yet..it is time to change your managers! cheers!,0,0,0,0,191703
Love this app. Best Subsonic mobile client that I've found so far...but  one feature that would make this a 5-star rating is: Add a feature to browse offline files via ID3 tag (if this is possible...or let me know if I'm just overlooking something and the feature is already there) I have my music organized in various folders by genre and in certain genres that have a huge number of artists  they are organized in alphabetic sub-folders by artists name (such as A-B  C-D  E-G  etc)  and by only having option to browse offline by folder  it makes it hard to browse my downloaded songs to find what I'm in the mood to listen too unless I remember exactly what I have downloaded and exactly what I want to listen to. I prefer to use DSub  but for offline music  I currently tend to go back to Google Play Music since I can browse offline files easier by just a list of everything that is downloaded and I can scroll through everything. Thank You!,1,0,1,1,173265
Allways review! Its a great thing. Thanks everyone Been skeptical with everything thats been going on for awhile now. checking out DDG awhile back and was very interested. Been testing several and even looking for a customizeable one instead of making my own that switches themes would be nice.I bet who ever is behind DDG is LeGit!... If you feel like being more secure and standing up for the 4th? Amndt. You could always grab a Tor and Torfox along with DDG. I hear it gives the FBI rights to track you though..whocares. Also DDG is fastest and smoothest SE of the ones Ive tried so far. Simular to StartPage which I like the idea of old google devs making DDG has obviously made some improvements  Ive saved enough time so far like my unknown spurs fan down their callin scroogle for what it seems to be nowadays to write you guys my lovliest and longest review Evr! Thx DDG. I just really like it. Now send me some customizable widgets!!!!!,1,0,1,1,48522
"After trying a number of different apps  I was frustrated by the overkill so many of them thrust upon you. I wanted a clean  fast  truly useful app for using on my phone quickly and easily. After using K-9 Mail for a while now  I am completely happy with it. I appreciate being able to set the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""dark theme"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for one thing. I also appreciate being able to simply click on the icon and get an immediate  updated list of my emails with the first couple of sentences included. It is all easy to scan and scroll through without a lot of unneeded visual garbage or options. When you need an additional option  it appears at the logical place and time  not all the time whether you need it or not. Everything is easy to set and use  and K-9 integrates well with my Google email account. This is one of the very few apps of any type that I've found to be genuinely suited to and useful for quick-and-direct cellphone use.""""",0,0,1,1,278344

"Nice app  but has two issues: 1) it does not accept user entered description. I have set up automatic upload to OSM after tapping on """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Stop"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and default description. During capturing today's tracklog I customized the description (using the pencil icon in the left bottom corner) to something else to see whether it will be used. Now I see on my OSM account that it has not  the file has the usual default description. 2) often duplicates uploaded files. I have just returned from lunch  I made three tracklogs. Two of them were duplicated. Well  it comes to my mind now that I ended two tracklogs at places with wi-fi (remembered in my phone). So maybe after pressing """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""STOP"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" it uploaded the tracklog using LTE  then the phone switch to the wi-fi and for whatever reason the GPSLogger repeated the transfer.

"Useless misleading data on Galaxy Note 2 The mA value displayed by this app is meaningless  it displays the reference value not the actual charging value. Imagine your car speedometer would always display the maximum speed your car can travel at  but not the actual speed right now. How useless! The app displays the charging amps as 1698mA  but thats the reference charging value  not the actual. For days I've been trying to debug a battery charging problem using this app  and was totally misled by this number that it kept displaying. This made me believe that my stock charger (2A output) was working as expected  so I was trying to figure out a problem with my phone instead.

Yea  won't import. I tried it every way. Export on my phone and copy file to my tablet and it says Error and won't import. Even when I do a new calendar and export. It won't even import back to a fresh install on same device  phone. If I may  I think it would be better if you focused on backing up the app not just the data. This way it would backup the categories and their colors  etc... I love this widget too. Makes a great looking home page. Please make it backup and restore. I also love that it is not dependent on GCalendar. If you use GDrive for backup it should also have access to that data on the SD too and then it would pretty much role the Playstore! :-) ...... I was so excited to see the new update for exporting and importing. Really bummed it doesn't work. Wish it was a true backup and restore of the app data. Please don't give up.

Bought it for Chromecast support but unimpressed I specifically purchased this for use with the Chromecast and it just isn't reliable enough for that function as of writing this. I realize the Chromecast is fairly new  so the rating may seem unfair  however this app doesn't seem to be much different from the actual Subsonic app. At least not different enough to justify the price. I'm using this on a Nexus 10 which can be fickle about WiFi connections. Yet  it streams Netflix and other Chromecast enabled content without issue. Dsub  stops playing albums & playlists for no reason. Physically connecting the N10 to the stereo and using the Subsonic app to connect to my server has no streaming issues. If you don't like ads  by all means purchase this app for use with your Subsonic server. I appreciate that someone is developing apps for use with Subsonic and I am happy to contribute. Unfortunately  my expectations are not yet met.,0,1,1,1,173562

Calls are surprisingly clear and low letency on direct connection  WiFi or Bluetooth  but there's no packet flow control so talk slow to avoid losing syllables when the buffer plays catch-up. If however there is a WiFi‚ÜîBluetooth relay in the pipeline  voice is useless; stick to text. A two hop text (through BT anyway) could be anywhere between a couple seconds to over a minute  but does eventually arrive. Messages currently lack an accessible sent time/date stamp. Requires some reading to really get how each option works. Note to some other reviews: root is only required for AdHoc mode  which is an Android design limitation. Other modes work fine. Resilience is lacking  which is forgivable in experimental stage. I find myself every hour or so having to cycle the services and Bluetooth off and on to reconnect to peers. Plus  some other apps (like OpenGarden FireChat) will kick off AdHoc mode and possibly other interference.,1,0,0,1,64518
Recently used Timeriffic to fix an issue on my old android tv box (PixePlay Kuro TV). My TV  android box  Fiber ONT and router are usually switched off or on at the same time. The android box does not have an internal battery to keep the clock current  so it has to get the time from the network. Trouble is  the ONT and router takes about 1min 40 secs to connect to the internet and android box connected by Ethernet does not attempt to refresh the request for automatic time from the network. It will always start its time at 8am  year 2000. Used Timeriffic to set a task to switch on the wifi at 8.02am and 8.03am then switch off wifi on 8.04am and 8.05am. When its wifi is switched on  the ethernet will be disconnected. The toggle between wired and wireless network mode triggers a time request and updates the date and time. Hope this workaround continues to work. Cold started the ONT  router and android tv box. Verified working.,1,1,1,0,16054
"Finally found the launcher I was looking for This was just the launcher I was looking for. One flaw with Android is that in order to open up a new app you have to return to the home screen. That's too many taps. Home Button Launcher (HBL) resolves this issue beautifully. And while other home button swipe-up launchers I checked out offer this feature  the UI and screen customizations in HBL are just better: You can sort apps  control the size of app icons and text  create tabs  change the order of your tabs as well as swipe between them  which is a smart use of Android gestures. I also checked out full-OS launchers like Action Launcher  but none of those let you launch an app while in another app like HBL does. The only bug I've come across is when you select """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""No title bar"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" under Settings; when you do that  the Settings button disappears along with the title bar and you can't back to it.""""",1,1,0,1,38623

Up until recently  this app was the single best way to use Wikipedia  and I would have gladly given it 100/5 stars; it was amongst my top 3 most used apps. However  lately  likely as the result of some update  it will spontaneously crash roughly 1 out of 3 times I open a new tab  and  even worse  roughly 8 out of 10 times I attempt to add an article to a reading list. In each case  when the app is restarted  it will have reverted to a state prior to the current session. Since  while exploring a new subject  it crashes as often as twice per minute  it has effectively become nigh unusable. The current 3-star rating I've given is an average  in the hope that this issue will be addressed soon: when working properly  it is easily a 5-star app  but in its current state  I wouldn't give it a single one. Please implement a fix for this issue ASAP  it is an irreplaceable tool for kickstarting research on a new subject!,1,1,1,1,108097
Initially it worked well. Could find most of what I looked for  although i had to weed through a zillion covers first. Unfortunately  I have to go through a thousand hoops to close the app. And now  there is nothing but covers. And  if I delete the app  I lose the music. So  yeah  it's good at first  but idk if it's really worth the hassle and memory it requires Response - whenever I click exit I MUST watch the ads that pop up or the app will not close. And  that is ONLY after I've done this at least 3X. Sometimes as many as 7X. So  when I am trying to conserve battery it is EXTREMELY irritating. I don't use an SD card. I have lots of storage on my phone  no need for it. Other apps download the music to my phone. This one doesn't even let me move the music over to my mp3 player. It's weird. And annoying.

Better than the interpreters I've used so far. As with the other two interpreters I've tried with my Android tablet  I used Anchorhead as a benchmark. My first impression is a very favorable one! I like that it connects to IFDB and grabs images for games it recognizes  and that it looks for new games that you had downloaded every time you launch this app. Another big deal is that the Enter key does not double-echo  unlike with the other interpreters I used before. There's just one bug I've encountered. There are two places in Anchorhead where the Inform menu is put to use. The first time you activate a menu is fine  but if you activate the same menu a second time  the list does not populate. All said  I love this app  and I'll probably continue to use it until I get around to playing something where the menu bug becomes a deal-breaker.

Great simple interface for passively tracking  but it misses steps  doesn't save data beyond a week  and doesn't count in realtime. I tried this after hearing it was tailored to the Nexus 5's built-in pedometer  but found that it still seems to come up short. When manually counting steps it seems to miss about 1 every 25 steps  and this corresponds to being a few hundred short by the end of an average day (~10 000 steps). Admittedly  this is better than most apps... but there are nonetheless other apps that seem to miss fewer steps. Another major issue is that it only tracks steps for a week  not saving the full record. And a minor annoyance is that it doesn't seem to count steps in realtime... rather  it seems to bulk-update after some unknown length of time. So I'll wake up and walk a mile to work and it'll read only 7 steps when I sit at my desk  but sometime by lunch it'll jump up to a couple thousand.,0,1,0,1,95635
I just wasted an hour trying to figure out how to transfer epub books that I already own to my phone without having to email them. I should be able to simply put the books into the FBReader directory on my Google Drive and have them appear in the app. NOPE I tried opening the books in the PC version in hopes that they would sync to Google Drive...NOPE. Uninstalling this app & trying something else...maybe just use Calibre to convert files to mobi & read them in my Kindle app. When I try to open a file on the PC  the search path defaults to a sub-directory of My Documents & I can't change that path even though I store this kind of content elsewhere on my computer (external drive). It's probably possible to do what I want with this app  but I have limited patience when the learning curve is this steep.

Simple and effective Have been looking around and tried about 8 others with various problems from messy interfaces  obtrusive ads and various restrictions. This simple but effective app does the job. In the notes it states to download separate sync app (I didn't notice this at first) and once this is done you can store your password file on the major cloud bases such as Dropbox. Would be great to have the companion app either integrated or a link in the main app to prompt new users to download if sync required (just for slow people like me) Also  an idea possibly for future development... have a sync file for app preference settings (such as default symbols  timeout etc) so that it only has to be set once and will follow the pattern across several devices (optional use incase anyone prefers different settings on each device).

A superb bit of kit. I'm using this instead of the official ExpressVPN app to automatically bring up and tear down my VPN connections. This is because the ExpressVPN app doesn't expose any intents  so connections can't be automated using Tasker. Using OpenVPN for Android and the Tasker OpenVPN Plug-in remedies this deal-breaker. This allows me to automatically disconnect from ExpressVPN when I connect to my home wi-fi (because the whole house is already transparently routed over ExpressVPN via the router behind the cable modem)  and reconnect again when I leave the house and revert to mobile data. You can even select which apps should make use of the VPN  so you can have  for example  a US TV profile for Netflix  Hulu  etc. and a UK TV profile for the BBC iPlayer  ITV Hub  All 4 and My5.

I'm pretty amazed at this emulator.. I really wasn't holding out much hope... but I can now play Dreamcast games on my phone! Only tested a few titles - Virtua Tennis 1 & 2 and Resident Evil Code Veronica... there are a couple of glitches on the tennis games but they're totally full-speed and completely playable.. and I'm blown away at how well Code Veronica (one of my favourite games) works. Would love to see this emulator improved with a slightly better UI and some extras like Save States. Also I had some problems with the touch-screen controls (they were slightly off) but I use a bluetooth controller anyway as touch-screen is awful (8BitDo Nes30 Pro) and that works great with this emulator. All in all SO impressed and hope this gets some good support - I would definitely pay for this emulator if it meant that more improvements were made... 5 Stars if the UI fixes and save states are implemented.,1,1,1,1,3630

I really like this application. It has some great plugins (TTS text-to-speech)  lots of customization  and the ability to pull books from multiple sources. It is my main 'go to' e-reader. However  the only weakness is in the lack of support for tables in ePub documents. I'm not really sure why this is  as tables certainly aren't a recent addition to the HTML/ePub markup. I have many e-books (travel guides  technical publications  etc...) that present information in tables  and when rendered by FBReader  it is a useless mess. I know that there are some HTML purists who feel that tables -- like the <frameset> and <blink> tags -- are an abomination and all layout must be via <div> or <span>...but I hope the FBReader people are not among them. Support for tables would be enough to move my review to 5 stars. If it were a feature of the Premium app  that would be reason enough for me to purchase it.,1,0,1,1,287224
Looks almost as good as the Linux circle icons I was hoping like crazy that Numix would release circle icons for Android. I've been using their circle icon pack and Window/GTK+ theme on Linux for a long time and love what they have done with Linux theming. It's great that they have entered the Android market since the devs are very talented. To people who are saying that they are missing icons  aside from giving them time since they are always looking for more icon suggestions  if you are running a alternative launcher like Apex or Nova  you can manually change the icons that aren't changed from this app. And to the guy griping about them not making icons for Samsung's proprietary bloat software like S Note  Lol. Also  really  why would they have the Tardis wallpaper? I'm surprised they aren't getting into legal issues by showing it in a screenshot. Go bust out your Google-fu and look for it.,0,1,0,1,24761

Well this program was used in the hacking of my gaming account on Warthunder  I managed to gain access back into the account via their support system with proving that I am the real owner of the account. Their support staff kept insisting that using this crap is the best way to protect my account and now that I have access back into my account I should re activate this 2 step process using this APP. So I took their advice and although I had gone through and changed my password about 5 times that day the hackers could still access my account because of this APP  I tried to deactivate all other devices to no avail they could still gain access even after password changes  deactivation of this app being used for access to my account and then reactivation.

Almost perfect It downloads puzzles and plays perfectly. The features I use work. I didn't care for some of the defaults but you can change them  luckily. It would be nice to see the puzzle name above the clues  sometimes that helps in solving things. I'd like to change the background color in the puzzle list. Both are nearly white and difficult to read. Also  I've never seen a date sort work. My guess is that it sorts on the day you downloaded the puzzle and not the puzzle's release date. Hmm  possible update items? Update: I touched a puzzle to open it and I saw the puzzle move to the right and off the screen. I was almost done with that puzzle  but could no longer it find it anywhere. So I began swiping the other puzzles and they too disappeared. I found a few in archive and swiped them again and poof  gone. What happened to them? I don't know  but now I'm mad and removed this program.,1,0,0,1,120396

Pre-installed app on Samsung Galaxy 3 & I didn't need it so I started by turning it off. However  any time the phone is restarted the app starts up as well & tells me so by placing a left hand print in the corner of my screen. Got so annoyed w/it (& the process of having to go in to the settings  go thru 3 steps to turn it off  not to mention having the app yell at me if I forgot to turn my volume off) that I disabled the app but it's STILL happening! So  now I've come here to re-enable the stupid app just so that I can shut it off again because since disabling it  it doesn't show up in the settings anymore but still  somehow gets activated. I'm sure it serves its purpose well for those who truly need it & I think it's a great idea  but for me it's just a nuisance. It can't be uninstalled  just disabled but clearly that doesn't work.

This is a great feature to be able revert back to previous work. my feedback: maybe the word update button in the draft or post can be change to save? or maybe  we can have sync button to get the latest updated draft or post either in the web or in our phone  before we start writing. this app can check for the last modified date either in our phone and the one in the server  right?

Like the app. overall. I've already added over 80 books with many  many more to go. A couple of issues  though. 1. There are too many steps to check off that you have read a book - select the book  select the edit icon  select notes  select that you've read it  then select save. Given that marking a book as read is a common occurrence  it seems like marking a book as read would be easier. 2. When I try to scan Barcode/ISBNs  sometimes it tells me that the ISBN is invalid  but when I enter the ISBN manually  the book is found. Beyond those two issues  though  I like the software and am looking forward to finally getting my library cataloged. Update: Since this upgraded to version 5.2.0 - It hasn't gotten any better about scanning the ISBN. Half the time it doesn't find it until I key it in manually. Also  it seems to take longer now to find the book after the ISBN is entered.,0,1,0,1,158536

"Great for newbies too! I'm relatively new to the world of IF  and this app has been a great introduction. It directs new users to some beginner (tutorial) stories  and makes it easy to find games that interest you.

I found a temporary fix for the latter issue by selecting the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""auto collapse keyboard"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option under settings  but this makes it so I have to manually select the text entry field every time before typing - annoying  but better than the program interpreting one press of the enter button as two.

I installed this app on a Samsung Galaxy S3. After installation I went through and set EVERYTHING to lockdown mode. Nothing should have been going or coming on WiFi or Mobile. Surprisingly  traffic from my phone increased dramatically. This firwall was unable to help whatsoever in fact  it seems to have compromised my phone. I know this because I have a WatchGuard Firewall in my network between the modem and internal network so I can see every single packet of traffic on my network. Most people probably do not have such a device as they are used in Commercial businesses usually. Very disappointed. To install this I uninstalled LostNet No root firewall. As old as it is  the LostNet Firewall seems to have done a MUCH better job even though the IP tables lists are apparently dated.

"Playlist support is very counter-intuitive. Just before I posted this review (which would have been very different)  I figured it out. To actually play a whole playlist rather than one track from it  you have to long press on the name of the playlist and then select play from a bunch of options in a list that pops up. Who would think of that? Poor UI decision there. You should either let people know how that works  or just put a big """"""""""""""""Play all"""""""""""""""" button beside each playlist in the list. The point is to make it convenient to fire up a playlist when you're on the go  not fiddle around with submenus. I very nearly uninstalled this because it appeared to be unable to handle .m3u playlists properly. Additionally  we NEED the ability to filter out folders that contain audio but not music.

I used to carry extra long VGA and USB cables so that I could position my laptop on a rostrum and to one side of a presentation. No longer so! Thank you Impress Remote. I recommend just using a hand held lasar pointer and don't give up on Bluetooth connection problems - it does work! My own problems with Bluetooth are due to a poor laptop and not this App. For large auditoriums or where the Bluetooth range is poor  definitely set up a WiFi connection. Now my laptop can be wired and left close to the data projector  and I just stand nearby  tablet in hand. Much better for audience attention as I can move about. Highly recommended. Improvements? Better resolution for the notes on handheld devices would be nice  but not essential. For some reason hidden slides in a presentation are shown by this App  the workaround is easy - save and use an abridged presentation.,1,1,0,1,36239
Worst of all worlds: It works enough to think maybe you can make it be useful but just ends up wasting hours of your time until you realize it's just broken. Lots of settings which is great.... but not explained so bad. Wants stary/stop time for day/night which is good... but it won't for example let you go past a certain time (aka now aka daytime). It lets you but if you go back it says a different time unless you stop at a certain point. Warnings to change settings but you think you did and nothing. Can't get it to stop taking pic every 10 seconds no matter how I fiddle with motion sensitivity. Could be useful - but I wish I had my afternoon back =( =( Shut down the entire app very clearly ... and then 2 min later - clicking every 10 seconds even though no evidence it's running.

Works fine but I wish it had more features. 1. Different skip amount for forward and back (like Audible). When I skip forward it's usually to find a certain spot in the book and I would use 30 sec or more. When I go back it's usually to hear something that I just missed and I would set it to 5-10 sec. 2. Optional book-timeline. In an audiobook I do not care about chapters and I don't care if I'm 5 min into chapter 7. I want to know that I'm 55 minutes into a book that is 7 hours long. Looking at timeline chapter by chapter gives me NO idea how far I'm into the book!

Can't understand the 5 stars It doesn't seem able to manage its own internal files. Several times I had to go into /data deleting swapfiles of Vim Touch's config files. It doesn't seem to have any resilience to its own preference settings. Even if your phone is rooted  don't set Vim Touch's Root option! It will never start again so you can't switch the option off. Other pref settings and normal vim uses also do this. And oh wow: *don't* try using vim encryption. Hangs and force quits everywhere. Then it made 3 of my files become zero size. All my 40+ others apps are working fine. I can't understand the 5 stars for Vim Touch. Perhaps people are just enjoying it as a toy or a novelty. But if you try to do anything half-serious with it it will break and take some of your files with it. (HTC one rooted with very stable CM10 and no problems in other apps),0,1,1,0,36590

Without any shadow of doubt in this world (or the next)  this is the worst app that I have stumbled upon in my whole life. If you are very profoundly disabled (which  fortunately  I am not)  I fully accept that it (just) may be the best thing since sliced bread. But if you are NOT so disabled  then do yourself a massive favour  and RUN A MILE!! Why?? Because once you have downloaded it onto your phone or laptop  you will find it is the worst anti-social virus you have ever experienced. I absolutely HATE it!!!! It almost makes me wish that I had never been born!!! This so called 'app' makes me wish that I did not own a mobile cell phone! The one that I used to own (before I discovered this app)  I went to the expense of hiring an expensive digger  to enable me to crush it beyond all recognition.

Great that there is this app  the native app is terrible. But it has a lot of rough edges; brightness is crazy  when I slide up it increases  at the top it decreases again and sliding down decreases 10% or so and then leaves the lights at 90% brightness. The disco mode cannot be turned off  you need to kill the app to turn this mode off. When I only use 2 zones  I always have 2 times 4 zones in the app  the maximum.

I bought OsmAnd+ when the navigation still worked somehow. I took an account that each newer version will provide more and more fixes and upgrades. But it worked totally different. With current release the navigation is totally disaster and useless anymore. The most I hate it now is very long time to calculate the route  it takes so much time that I can ride few kilometers and navigation is still in calculation. And when navigation lost the route it starts to calculate it again and it takes next minutes  where I can ride next few kilometers without map. It didn't work that way before. It is dissapointing considering the fact that google maps is free and has offline mode now (not full offliine  but it navigate much better).

Greetings! So  the other day i was playing Capcom vs SNK 2 (J) Gameplay is good and the speed is also good but the only problem would be that The sprites aren't proper. Like  it shows broken sprites. I really hope you fix that asap~ Cus i used to play this game when i was a child and like  it brings back so many memories. Hope you can fix that Issue and if you could notify me after fixing it  that would be just great. I have the Bios. I have the Iso. Now just need a bit more to make it perfect. Hoping for a suitable reply. Works well in the menus  and the speed in-game is reasonable  but the characters in 2D are completely glitchy and it makes it unplayable at this stage. Sound stutters too once in a while. But the sound problem is alright lol since I listen to music instead and i turn off the sound from the emulator. Please fix that :'(,1,1,0,1,3913
Don't bother with India/Pakistan articles. They are biased the administrators seem to allow revert-wars on the articles many editors from are even trying to sell their own books by referencing them in the citations. Known nationalistic websites are used as sources as well. Do your research elsewhere for those subjects. When I was editor I was asked in email by both Indian and Pakistani users as well as administrators to help them get their POV pushed into those articles. I think the same thing can be said for the religious articles too. The only decent articles are on science watch for pharma articles those are problematic too with edit-wars and over egging the negative addictive and carcinogenic effects of vital live saving medication (drugs) based on personal agendas.

What can I do about the reboots? This has been my go-to method for playing music on my mobile devices for years. I love the server product (purchased long ago)  and the mobile app has always been great. However  since I upgraded my phone (T-Mobile Galaxy S4 - M919) to Kit Kat the app has been unusable for me. It works for a few tracks and then spontaneously reboots my phone. This happens when using wifi or mobile data connections.

Does pretty much what I want it to  but... The app is very good overall  however it's lacking a few customisations that would take it to the next level. In particular  it would be great to be able to customise the output string on a per application basis so that I can have it say something like 'New message from [contact name]' rather than reading aloud private messages in public. Apart from the privacy concerns  it can be far too verbose. This would also negate the need to start notifications by saying the app name  as you could tell it to say 'New email from...' or '[Name] tweeted...'.

I was a bit peeved that the signature option went away  but got over it. HOWEVER.... Now you took away the upload photo size?!? üò°üò† What the hell were you thinking? 'Image optimizer'? At 3000x3000? My theme ends at 720px  why would I need any bigger? Now I must edit each one  delaying my posts from posting  my upload time is longer by having to upload larger files and usually has many local saves  due to the internet being taxed by large files in which also fills my media space Gaaaa! I even noticed the multi pix upload is gone. Lucky  I don't upload that way. Just tell me who I have to come over there and slap. Seriously. Please put it back in next update.

As a way to find NPR shows  it's OK. As a media player  it's a train wreck. It's nice to have all my NPR shows in one place (as long as they're not more than a week old). It's just too bad that one place is this app. It's super clunky  it doesn't remember where you left off if you used any apps since the last time you used it  so long podcasts like Car Talk become a guessing game every time you start back up and try to figure out where you left off. It also  for some boggling reason  can't be controlled from the lock screen  so better just set it and forget it in your car  or you're probably going to die. Also  it can't store the podcast on your device  so if you have weak signal  you're just not going to advance to that next track. If there was any other app that I could find to listen to my NPR podcasts  I would.,1,0,1,1,162455

Great APP  Horrible widget For as long as I've been on Android  I've used K-9 email along with MailListWidget for K-9. For some reason  the MailListWidget is no longer available and I can't get it to install on my Note 7. So I now have no unread email list widget. Which means I'm using the standard Android email client. Why  after all these years have you not built a mail list widget?! I have always liked having a list of new emails listed right on my home screen and I could select the one I wanted to read. Now I have to open the client  hit each folder to find out what new emails I have. Love K-9  HATE the lack of widget support. Since K-9 doesn't meet my needs any more  I give it a 3 instead of the 5 I would give it on my Note 4 where the third party widget still worked. Wish K-9 had a native mail list widget.,1,0,0,1,278158

This app hasn't been updated in over a year. I wonder if the developers are even listening anymore. I have used and loved SMS Backup+ for years  but since installing it on my HTC One M9 running Android 6.0  it isn't working correctly. First  it wouldn't restore all of my old messages. Fine  they're still stored in Gmail. Not a huge deal. But now the process of even backing them up has become rife with bugs. It crashes almost constantly during automated backups. I have to run it manually every so often to make sure messages are being saved. I would have moved on to other alternatives by now  but I want (and haven't been able to find) something that uses Gmail like this one does  as I love having all of my texts searchable in that format. Please fix this app so I can update to 5 stars  as it has long deserved.,0,1,1,1,21294
"A huge """"""""""""""""thank you"""""""""""""""" to the developer for this app. It does what other non-root firewall apps weren't able to do. Purchased everything to support development. If there is 1 feature I would love to see  it's wildcard hostname filtering at a global and app level. It's great that this app supports (and reports) all data and protocol usage  supports IPv6  per-app filtering and data usage  logging  packet capture  even subnet routing and filtering based on data network type (including 2G/3G/4G) if some of your networks are metered or you want different restrictions on them. And a speed graph notification bar with configurable history duration. I'm impressed 1 developer has created this - kudos to your skills. Oh  and it's honest AND open source!

Does not work at all on my Note 3 The app appears to be very buggy. While setting it up Amazon MP3 player did not appear in the list of apps to offer. I would up going through the setup 10 or more times while trying to get it to work. Amazon MP3 appeared once out of all the times I was setting it up. That was the 5th or 6th attempt. It disappeared from the list after that never to return. More importantly the app does nothing when I connect to bluetooth in my car. Prior to install the app I would get a seemingly random music app starting when I entered my car. I got this app to try to work around this Android bug so I could choose which app  if any to launch. But the behavior has not changed. I still get a random music app starting up when I enter the car. I do not know what  if anything  the app is doing.,1,1,1,0,12367
(EDIT) I've been doing it wrong the whole time and the game's rom was zipped and I didn't realise it. Now my game runs perfectly smooth and it's amazing! It brings me nice memories of me playing against the clock with my cousins on sonic adventure 2. We used to finish the whole game in about 3 hours  we had so much fun. Now I can play all of my dreamcast games. Thank you so much!!! P.D It does take some time to set it up though  just look through some forums and you'll be alright.

People need to be patient! The app needed to be updated to match the new style guides  and I  for one  think it looks much better now! Of course there are a few glitches here or there but the developer is responding quickly. I think sheer volume of negative responses demonstrates how many people rely on this app every day  and let's remember it's free without any ads or anything. Let's all be a little more patient when we notice a small issue. I can guarantee the dev won't leave us with a broken app for long (and in my experience it's far from broken) Further  if you're having an issue with a specific puzzle  I can virtually guarantee it's because that source has changed something. When that happens this app's dev has always been very quick to respond whenever possible (it's not always within his power).,0,1,1,0,120508
Download this now! This is the greatest messaging app I've ever come across. Seriously  the interface is seamless and actually IMPROVES with updates. You can now access on your phone or on a computer and everything's synced. The voice messaging feature is perfect for couples (and others) to maintain intimacy that text can't always give you. I can share websites  gifs  pictures  and more with just a click. The only thing I'd love to see in the future are stickers with more variety of skin tone. I use this app with my bf (I'm black and he's white) and sometimes I like to send him cute character stickers. Current stickers are still adorable  but it'd be nice to send him one that really reminds him of me!

Warriors will always know a pot of strength  mages a scroll of identifay  and rouges seem to like maps.

I love how you can create a background  then load an image with a transparency over it. I am using it for web design. Other apps are hard to use  loaded with features and filters that are useless or cost extra just to activate stuff. Most paid apps have a roadmap that dead ends  anyway. It's great to see something wonderful for free. Update... I created a bunch of textures as a backdrop for my logo. Both created in markers  but now  all of the sudden the program is clearing the screen when I load the logo over the texture. I would rather have it just loading on top  like it has been doing. Still love it! 5 stars all day.,1,0,1,1,9002
Please Make Highest Mental Activity Longer Please Make Highest Mental Activity Longer. As someone with ADHD-Predominantly Inattentive  the ADHD preset is useless. Unlike those with Hyperactive ADHD  which Alpha waves actually calm and relax them. It's the complete opposite effect with Inattentive ADHD. Too much Alpha tends to make us sleepy  drowsy and unfocused. The Higher Beta  but especially Gamma waves help us the best. Especially when doing homework or studying. Too much beta makes me irritated after 30 minutes  but Gamma waves keeps me focused for hours. An hour would be ideal if possible. Something longer than 15 minutes because as soon as I'm completely focused  SILENCE and I have to replay it. The constant stopping after 15 minutes is a bummer.

LOVE this app  but a yr into using it  I have so MUCH... Please implement folders/tags  or the ability to add to notebook. Maybe in copy menu: Clip-copy (is recycled) Clip-update/replace  & Clip-save launches a box with an option to Tag. Similar to &lt; to Keep. Needs a reminder to clean out clips every () week(s).

Database lacking (KLOR nowhere to be found). Dropping way points shows on map  but not on plan page  so unable to edit. Also unable to delete a way point on map view so couldn't even switch plan on the fly. I want this app to work  I hate apple and also hate foreflights inability to work with the Android market. Flight plan go has major issues as well but does better in my opinion. If I could combine these two I'd pay the same subscription fee I had with foreflight for years. This one is not user friendly unfortunately. FPG is more user friendly yet doesn't allow touching map to bring up terminal area info and plates for an airport you tapped  but this one does  yet editing and navigating the UI is awful. Frustrating. Make a product that competes with foreflight functionality and I will PAY.,1,1,1,1,161699
Good and Bad. Kudos for work in progress. Good: motivates improvements by competitors' avgps apps  direct-to useful  inflight lookup of nav  wx  and apt info  excellent with FSX and Stratux adsb. Bad: UI clunky  flight planning unusable. Summary: Useful only for direct-to function and looking up info. Assembling such good data is an achievement  but needs a better framework for the interface. Still  it's better than paper charts or no charts  as it's free! APA excells in its connectivity apps  too. Recommend this over the also free FltPlanGo  which has UI/planning issues  too. For serious flying  rely on superb Foreflight  iFlyGps  or Garmin Pilot  for which you pay reasonable subscription fees. These pros - notably the first two - offer rock solid data and usable interfaces without issues.,0,1,0,1,161241

Telegram is a fantastic app/platform that easily can compete with WhatsApp. My big issue with it on Android is that notifications don't work. They apparently don't use Android's built in notification system  instead choosing to roll their own (as is the case with their encryption as well). While I'm all for innovation  the system simply doesn't work. While using this app  I missed over 60% of the message notifications  and wasn't aware I had received a message until I opened the app. Since this is a messaging app  that obviously won't do. If it weren't for this one problem  and they used a tried and proven encryption method  this would 100% be my go-to messaging app. I still love it  but the fact that notifications don't consistently work is unfortunately enough for me to not use the app.,0,1,0,1,154603

I like this app but there are a few things I wish I could change. I wish I could see all of my cards in a deck in a list so I could choose which to look at. I wish I could make decks on my computer and there were a way to synch them on my phone through an account. I wish the push notifications would send when cards are due  and not only when I actually open the app. What use is that? I wish the push notifications didn't resend any time my screen turns off in the middle of studying a deck. I wish there were some pre-made decks for students in popular subjects such as anatomy or psychology or languages. Maybe charge a dollar for access to pre made decks. It would really be worth it  because making flashcards for anatomy consumes way more time than I can afford  really  but I have to do it.,1,0,0,1,97950

Fantastic app. Plays a very wide range of formats  and the interface is far ahead of the other similar players out there. There is really only one thing which is lacking: headset controller integration. It would be wonderful to be able to pause using the headset button  or jump forward or back in the playlist. But  even lacking that  I prefer it over the alternatives. It is that good. Edit: Thanks Claudio for asking about that. I should have been more specific above. I have not had trouble with any of the various bluetooth controllers I have used  but the conventional wired variety unfortunately do not work. I still use these often because I run down the batteries on the wireless ones. Not a big deal surely  but I note it as the only thing which wasn't perfect. A really fantastic app.,1,0,0,1,72604

I'm extremely disappointed with this app and will be uninstalling it. I was extremely excited to see that there was a remote app for Kodi since the controls they have are very limited and in order to 'rewind' or 'fast forward' you have to swype the screen and it takes you to predetermined spots  making it difficult to find the exact spot you want. Maybe it's just my ignorance and laziness  but I assumed that this was a remote that would work on the Kodi app and not an entirely different app that ran Kodi on it. I only use Kodi to strem TV and movies via 3rd party add on's and for whatever reason this app doesn't allow me to use the add on's.

I have a nit. Actually  for my use case  it's a serious problem. As advertised  it does seamlessly connect with the calibre server on my local network. However  it (or maybe the install of FBReader Pro) removed the calibre server on a potentially external network  and I'm having trouble putting it back. I don't think it should have taken away a feature I had working. In other words  typing in the URL was a major pain  partly because it is not documented that the URL is different for FBReader than for a browser. It is now easy  if it's a URL on the local network. (You have to add /opds for FBReader). Typing the URL for a non-local network is still a major pain  if possible at all  and this plugin or some other part of the FBReader infrastructure is making me do it again twice.,1,1,0,1,26789

It's easy enough to root your device but then stumbling across this app without knowing what you're doing could easily destroy a device if someone doesn't use it correctly  especially if used on a tablet without a changeable/removable battery and you end up ruining your battery beyond repair by calibration etc. So a glossary of terms section in the settings  or even better an ? Icon next to each function explaining what it will affect if used would be ideal. I know a lot about these types of functions but some to me are even a little confusing and so need to be googled. Adding the ? info would definitely make it a 5 star app in my opinion.,1,0,1,1,45638
"I am continually amazed at the beautiful simplicity of the products  especially Google Play  that are available to me  and the rest of the world.

This is the excellent flash card so far that I have experienced. Previously I used Brainscape on iOS  but it lack of customization features comparing to Anky (and AnkiDroid). With this app  you are able to store and back up multimedia decks externally  and even share with others. That is above my expectations. I wish I know this app earlier. The second feature I like and use frequently is the playback  it makes much easy to review what have been learned. There is still room for improvements  for example  users can choose different algorithms/ways to select a card for studying/reviewing  randomly card selection is an option. The reason is that for big decks  too much repetition for some cards makes the learner tired and wastes time. That is a reason I dropped one star.,1,0,1,1,97842
"Could be improved if the bubble had two """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sensitivity"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" settings. I used a standard 24 inch framing level to find a a completely level place on my concrete floor to calibrate both my phone and the app. This app has the bubble move through 360 degrees of angle  while a framing level only provides meaningful reading for about 2 degrees on either side of the angle  a range of about 5 degrees  so when you are close to level the bubble does not add value with this app  but the readings do. Though on my phone even when sitting on a concrete floor the readings would flicker between a couple of tenths of a degree. I suspect this is a hardware (phone) issue not a software (app) issue. Also the app works without being online  and does not have ads.""""",1,1,1,1,63017
Ruined the app in the new update with 2 big problems. First is the feature of changing the entire interface language is very dumb. Now I am unable to view other language wikis and still understand my app. Fix it or make an option not to have it. Secondly  Wikipedia has ruined the link popups - the read article button no longer shows unless you scroll down to the bottom of the preview. This is retarded as I can no longer click the button no matter how much of the preview I've scrolled through. Waste of time. Even worse is that I've been unable to downgrade - any older version instantly crashes upon searching. Also still had my older issues of a Visual Editor not being available for mobile and also not being able to edit more than one section at a time. Please respond.,1,1,0,0,109816
Great to have  especially for free (I sorta wish I could pay $5 for a fully-developed version  but I suspect the developer is restricted by the open-source licence of the source code). As others have commented  it lacks some key features; for me  the buzz-kill is the inability to add comments. A bummer as I use this to create databases of books while I'm reading them. A work-around is to add comments on your computer via SCID or any of its variants. I had to do the following: Copy the 3 files associated with the database to my local computer  change the permissions  edit them in SCID or any of its variants  copy them back onto the Android device  then reload the database (for effects to be seen  one must load any random database and then reload the edited database).,1,0,0,1,25509
My favorite browser since I discovered it on vacation back in 2013 in California. You will not find a Faster  better browser  I guarantee it and if you do  tell me! Only have seen it on Android  may be other places  wish it was for all platforms. Being on an Android Tablet is even better and more choices. Our may run slower on a PC or Mac type platform  which is the only reason I can see why this browser isn't available everywhere  for if it was and acted the same way as it does on the Android platform  it would surpass Explorer  Chrome  Firefox  all of them as soon as it gained attention.

The app itself is great  having the same issue others have had with changing phones. My old phone broke  and I got a replacement phone (still using the SIM card from my old phone) and I still can't link my accounts. I was able to re-connect my google account (because of the text option) but nothing else. If you are on the same google account  with the same phone number as before  you should be able to sync with the other accounts you had on the authenticator. I had 2-step verification with my bank account  and now I can't log in because it needs a code. But the only way for me to get codes in the app on the new phone is to re-add the bank account  which I can't do because I need to be logged in to my online banking in order to generate a barcode or key. I'm trapped!,1,1,1,1,280014
11/24/2013: Love this file manager ? clearly made for actual use but still has an appealing  practical aesthetic. Launches instantly  even cold  and is very responsive?on my EvoLTE my brain is the limiting factor on how fast I can get things done. sFTP works flawlessly. Thumbnails are very nice for image heavy folders. Would love to see cut/copy to clipboard added (in addition to pane-to-pane) as both modes have their uses. Otherwise superb. Very Highly recommend. Update (Nov 2016): Been using GC as my primary file manager for more than 3 years now on 4 different phones. Had a few interactions with the dev in that time too. CANNOT RECOMMEND HIGHLY ENOUGH. This is still a superb file manager with a broad range of useful features that simply lets you get things done.,1,0,0,1,282494

The app continues to improve  which is impressive since it was pretty darned good right out of the gate. Easily my favorite all-time Android app  it fulfills a dream I had years ago when I got my first high-capacity iPod -- that I'd have access to all of my personal music collection (which then was a seemingly-absurd 250 GB  and which now is closing in on 2TB)  all of the time  no matter where I am. I still wish stream-of-consciousness browsing was easier (i.e.  that you could tap on the artist name during playback  or even the song name  and have an auto-search done -- as it is  you need to back out to a search field and input your search terms manually)  but I'm so impressed with the app overall that doesn't impact my enthusiastic 5-star rating. Truly excellent.,1,0,1,1,173360
A Great Hiking App I downloaded the free version and used for a week before buying the + version a few months ago. I have been delighted with its functionality and ease of use. Yes  you do have to pay attention to the guidance given on how to set it up properly  but it is not difficult (I use a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 and a Motorola Moto G 3 phone using Android Marshmallow). Saving and replaying GPX tracks is easy (I save mine to the cloud)  the map detail excellent  the overlays are handy (I use a Microsoft Earth overlay option at 30%  transparency to give a little more detail to the OSM vector map)  contours and other plug ins are excellent.

New version running better Since my previous review  the app has improved greatly. I haven't noticed it skipping songs when buffering. The big improvement I see is adding play/pause/skip to the lock screen when the app is playing. This also connects into bluetooth devices like the Jambox. I can pause my playlist or skip a story from my Jambox. Great addition! A pet-peeve of mine with the app is the confirmation dialog every time I clear the playlist. I primarily use the app for news stories so I clear the playlist daily to remove outdated segments. A better solution would be to allow playing of all segments in a program (ie. Morning Edition) without adding them to the playlist. If you added a way for me to donate to the app  via Paypal for instance  I would give!,0,0,0,1,162902
Finally a way to know WHAT is actually using ALL THAT SPACE! My wife & I both struggled with internal storage too full to install apps or take more photos  and running that low on storage also seems to cause phone problems in general. While the built-in storage tools is really good at showing you that all your space is gone (duh)  it's not much help in solving the issue. DiskUsage makes it dead simple to narrow down to exactly what folders and files are using that space and even what apps are responsible. Note: DiskUsage does not actually fix your problem or clean up files--it gives you the intel necessary for you to do that. Deciding what to delete and what to move and where to move it is still a bit of a technical exercise that might frustrate a lot of people.,0,1,1,1,73686
This app probably takes up 90% of my screen time on my phone. I'm addicted to crossword puzzles. Between the vast selection of puzzle libraries and the live-ish updating of ongoing publications  I'll never run out of games to play. Note  however  that I've been running Shortyz for years and although the app does get updated from time to time  the updates are sporadic at best. Bugs can go months before being addressed. The current bug plaguing the game is the Clues view zooms in ridiculously on the letter grid  making it difficult to use. But  like I said  the app does get updated and things do get fixed in time. This bug has been reported and I will wait until it's fixed. It's an annoyance regardless  so I'm docking it a full star for an otherwise stellar app.,0,1,1,1,120082
This is an essential suite for any user -- desktop & mobile. I use Dropbox to keep one file updated for all platforms. THIS version has two major failings however. The first is that while the desktop version(s) use a file: DATABASE.KDB as the default  this mobile version insists on looking for a file called KEEPASS.KDB instead.. The second is the slavish devotion to a SANS-SERIF font! Without serifs you cannot distinguish a lower case L from an upper case i! And if your password uses either one  you're in for some grief. I suppose a third issues is that no matter how often you use this  it NEVER remembers where the password file is  or what it's called. Having this (and other things) employ the fingerprint security would be a huge plus  but not deal-breaking.,0,1,0,0,115663

pretty great  three problems. 1: the cover image of every book shows up twice in my phone's gallery  flooding it with images. wish the app would save them internally and hide them from the gallery. 2: forces its own formatting instead of allowing the book to decide. i have several books that switch between centered and aligned  but fbreader forces only allows one way. 3. there was an error in one of the books i loaded into fbreader  so i deleted it  pulled a fixed version onto my phone  and hit rescan. what's in my book list? the original non-fixed version. i deleted the book again  uninstalled fbreader  used a root-explorer to remove every trace of the app and book  re-installed  put the new book version in. and it STILL showed the old version. what gives?,1,1,0,1,287249
It used to work fine  but now every time I scan a QR code it will display the link of the page the QR code points to and after I either go to the page and then come back to the app  or just close the link and return to the app I get a message that the camera has failed and that I may have to perform a system reboot to re-enable it. This not only prevents me from using this app again  but it also disables my phone's camera! I have to reboot my phone to get the camera to work again. FAIL! This never happened in the past. I don't recall the last time I used it  so I don't know how many updates have been published since that time to narrow where the issue first came up. Too bad... I liked this WHEN it worked.

Not good enough Have had problems syncing (no automatic sync) and it is impossible to open files via the webdav function (How does one do it?). Without this I think this app is not suitable for research; I organise all my working papers on Zotero and use a webdav cloud to sync everything. I would love a papership type app in my device  that would let me access and read the files. Android is behind ios in terms of research tools. Zandy is going in the right direction  but is not quite there yet (look at papership for good ideas!). Hope this is changed soon  I am willing to reconsider my review if this changes.

Current version (as of this review) is unusable on my phone. For some reason  when switching to Clues mode  it zooms the entry boxes until they're huge and I can only see 4 on screen at a time. I can zoom out  but as soon as I move to a new clue it zooms back in like this. None of the zoom settings affect the zoom of the clues mode. Meanwhile  I can't work in puzzle view because my screen is too small. This all seems to work fine if you have a tablet  and it used to be my favorite game on my phone (when I could see 8-10 letters on the clue screen)  but it's just unusable on a small screen now.

Fun game with some serious flaws. Skills are almost completely useless. Item choice is almost irrelevant. And the drop rate of the rarest items is so low that by the time you've gone through the entire content of the game you will have killed 10% FEWER creatures than it would statistically take to farm just ONE legendary item. That is astronomically stupid. Who the hell wants to go through the entire game  then kill that many creatures again  plus another 10% besides  all in a small area of the map  the same creatures over and over again to get an item which  by that point  is useless because you already finished the game weeks ago? And then do it AGAIN for the next rare drop. Items that rare are useless. By the time you get them you no longer need them.,0,0,1,0,3510

The best MPD client on mobile devices MPDroid is by far the best MPD client on mobile devices. It's actually better than several full desktop clients I've tried. It's easy to use  does a great job of displaying cover art (check the mpdroid wiki)  lets you browse by folder structure or by tags and is all round very neat. The only long term annoyance I've noticed compared to a desktop client like gmpc is it doesn't support the composer metadata field but anyway it does let you go to the album folder so if you have any kind of sensible tagging and naming scheme you can always get the info you need. MPDroid improves with each release and MPD + MPDroid still has a place as a great way to enjoy your music collection  even in these days of DLNA/UPNP devices.,0,0,0,1,15290
Thanks for the fast and lightweight manager. It can grow to take place of the ES of the past.

Update 4/24/2016- I'm changing my review from 5 stars to two  because the instant upload feature just stopped working. I took four pictures today while out and about and none of them will upload even now that I'm back at home on wifi. I didn't change anything but it just stopped working.

This Remote app allows people to control Clementine from their Android device. What is Clementine you might ask? It's a free and open source music player that has a great wealth of features  and is available on the 3 major OSes. Thus  you require Clementine to use the Remote  but it's well worth it since it's a fantastic music player. You can do simple tasks like control the music with this app  but there are a few more things you can do all in the Remote. You can do playlists  search your library  get song info  and even download music to your device. Clementine Remote acts as a great companion to the standard Clementine player. Clementine on its own is awesome to use  and the Remote grants extra usability from the comfort of your Android device.,1,0,0,1,67027
These are the sorts of apps we need more of: simple  efficient  well designed  and without unneeded permissions. There is however one feature which is sadly missing from this app which is sorely needed: the ability to see and access external storage through OTG USB. I find myself having to to access my flash drives through the default explorer and moving the files into internal storage before Simple File Manager is able to see them. This means I can't  for example  install APKs directly from flash drives or immediately copy images and videos two and from them through Simple File Manager alone.

[UPDATE]None of the extension that I use (Inbox  Weather) seem to be updating the home screen info. So other than date/time  I now get little out of the widget. Too bad.[/UPDATE] After trying a number of clock widgets  this one seems like a keeper. Only used it for a couple of hours  so don't know if there are other issues  but the biggest improvement for me would be supporting double-tap  when the widget is expanded to the full home screen. Double tap turns the screen on/off on LG G3  and it's one of my favorite Android features. To make it work  I need to leave some free area on the screen  but this means  I cannot display everything I want in the wizard. Would be lot more user-friendly  if the widget just passed the double-tap signal to the OS.,1,1,0,1,159258
Pretty great lockscreen replacement for AMOLED screens‚Äîespecially on a Samsung (because their lockscreen is clunky garbage). There are just a few small changes that would make a WORLD of improvement  IMO  such as allowing more than one widget (there's plenty of space  why limit it?)  allowing widgets to be wider (again  the space is there  why the limit?)  being able to have widgets without overriding the stock clock  and being able to reposition the clock/widgets and maybe notification icons too. Also  custom apps/shortcut/actions for the corner gestures would be very useful too. No reason to limit those to phone and camera only. :P And lastly  an option to display ongoing notifications (maybe below the higher priority ones) would be nice too.,1,0,0,1,27864
This is a simple yet effective application and I use it mostly for video recording and it gives great results. My phone lacked features like changing exposure and tap to focus while video recording but this app made it so easy to use. The one problem is that the flash doesn't turn on while video recording and I didn't try to click pictures using the flash. I've tried many settings but none of them gets the flash to work. It's kind of random. Sometimes it will work and sometimes it doesn't. And it works sometimes only in auto mode. And just to be clear the flashlight of my handset is fine and has no issues. The default camcorder can use the flash to shoot videos. I'll be glad if the developers can see to it if there are multiple reports like this.,1,1,0,1,171263
Hello guys  I just recovered from the failure of google play services. I lost my clash of clash account because of that. I use SONY Tablet S. I uninstalled Clash of Clans.I uninstalled the current version of the google play services and google play games  and uninstalled all the updates of Google apps like hangouts  youtube  play music. I went to apk mirror website and downloaded google play services version 10.0.84 and google play games version 3.9.06. And I reinstalled Clash of clans and connected to my gmail account. And it worked flawlessly. Please try it. The unfortunate thing is that though I spoke to Google customer service they were unable to provide me the solution. Hope they rectify the problem with the current version of play services.,1,1,0,1,219432

I downloaded the free version and used for a week before buying the + version a few months ago. I have been delighted with its functionality and ease of use. Yes  you do have to pay attention to the guidance given on how to set it up properly  but it is not difficult (I use a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 and a Motorola Moto G 3 phone using Android Marshmallow). Saving and replaying GPX tracks is easy (I save mine to the cloud)  the map detail excellent  the overlays are handy (I use a Microsoft Earth overlay option at 30%  transparency to give a little more detail to the OSM vector map)  contours and other plug ins are excellent.

Dear Google  Fisher Price Is For Kids!! GOOD GRACIOUS GREAT BALLS OF FIRE  what on earth did you guys do to the UI? A 5-star security app  no doubt  but the new UI & icon are absolutely hideous lol.

You should add even more stuff into or even make a whole new sequel to Shattered Pixel Dungeon with the old characters and maybe like 2 new characters.

I will shortly uninstall this app. These are the issues: I don't like free apps  because developers feel free to include annoying notifications within the app. I'm repeatedly asked to donate. Well  I'd be happy to  if I thought that donating would make that notification (and the other little love notes) go away. I'm also not particularly happy that it runs at startup. I see no reason for it do so. I would be grateful if the developer would offer a paid version that gives more control to the user  fewer message popups and a less obtrusive push to like it on Google+ and Facebook. I'd be first in line to buy it under those conditions. For now  I've found a different app that will allow me the privilege of paying to keep the annoyances at bay.,0,1,1,1,37592
Terrific app! Thanks to all who work on it. Two small requests: 1. The language I'm learning uses three fairly obscure characters: ∆• ∆≠ ∆à. These show up fine on the desktop version  but render as blank spaces or a ? on the app. These misrenders then get synced back onto the database. Is there a chance this could get fixed  or should I go ahead and find alternate characters to represent them? 2. One of the advantages of a mobile app flashcard system is that you can easily create audio flashcards in the field. The current app requires five touches to record audio (+  Add  paperclip  record audio  RECORD). It would be great to be able to do this in fewer steps  though I realize that might not be possible without overcrowding the interface.,1,0,0,1,97745

Used to be great but no longer reliable & needs urgent fix! This WAS ONCE a really good basic alarm app without unnecessary gimmicks or permissions. But for almost a year now  there have been serious problems which haven't been fixed: (1) Snoozing the alarm more than once FAILS - as others describe  it counts down to the snooze time but then instead of ringing it resets to the next main alarm time. This is a FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM  because an alarm must be 100% reliable  or it isn't reliable at all. (2) It doesn't always override my SGS3 lock screen  so I have to enter the unlock pattern before I can snooze or cancel an alarm. It's very disappointing that these problems have been reported by me & others for many months but still persist.,0,1,0,1,92391
Lot of features  little left to desire It's a nice feature that you can order your books according to bookshelves  this will help you find your physical books. There's an option to export the data of your books  in case you need all your information on your computer. One thing I would mention  once you put a book to one bookshelf  I don't think that there is an easy way of moving it to an other bookshelf in the app like scanning it on another bookshelf. It supports a few scanner apps  from which google googles is the best  but I'd be happier if i-nigma was supported as it's very fast  or if I could add books by importing the ISBNs.

Checked the phone and it was almost all down to K9. Disabled background data ‚Äî hardly ideal ‚Äî but I was prepared to give the program another chance. Final straw happened a few days ago when I experienced serious internet connectivity problems  only to discover that K9 Mail had used over 60GB of wifi data over the previous month. At the risk of stating the obvious  this is insane! Having persevered with this for years  I've now given up  uninstalled and gained about 3 hours battery life per day. Should be removed from the Play Store.,1,1,1,1,278975
Poor accuracy Went for a walk at lunch today. Turned on my phone's GPS and started this GPS Logger app from inside my office building. Took me about 1 minute to get outside  walked about 20 minutes and then turned it off when I got back inside. It said I walked over 7 miles for a route I know is much less than 2 miles. At least this version is better than the previous one  that only logged points if my phone was on and the app was active. What I think should be changed is that when logging it started it should not start until the GPS gets a lock. I think it's using the previous location  which it should not do. And settings should show in their menu item instead of having to select each item to see what the value is.,1,0,1,1,285288
NEEDS UPDATE. I used to use this long ago even when I knew my iOS had apps that worked and especially looked better. But those were not available on Android. And after all this time something as simple as the intro screen shouldn't look low resolution. It's dated and stands out. But it does go with the simple look of the app. And I don't mean simple in a good way. Cheap looking for be another. If money is needed a paid version could be offered. Or if you don't want to see ads you could pay some money. This looks like something that's from the first generation devices and just stayed the same all these years. A lot of low end devices could use this? Okay  then make a version for the latest generation high-end devices.,1,0,0,1,167014

Fairly complete  fairly great (going to look if there is something better  thus MORE searching for a decent APP  or confirming that this is about as good as it gets - grrr). Gripes (thus reason to again search for better tool): 1.) The Settings have no defaults set. 2.) CPU Usage in Notification Area (which can be turned off) is fairly useless (and the Pulldown version has few choices)  because it's not so great overall disabling - thus that 'Feature' is no use (to ME)  so that's gone. 3.) Should have Settings Toggle to remove itself (and Android Process) from Listings. 4.) No hide for specific Process. 5.) Back Button easily EXITS  instead of going back.

This app is almost perfect. Though I would have 2 suggestions/requests: 1. The ability it add an image to use as album art. The automatic artwork is about 90% successful  it would be great to be able to easily add missing artwork simply. 2. Add an option to send a user saved SSH command to the source device. For example to be able to send a #sudo shutdown now# command to my Raspberry Pi running Runeaudio would be amazing. Aesthetically I prefer this app but I will have to (reluctantly) keep using the Runeaudio app as it has the shutdown command built in. However  despite the above  this app is way better than all the alternatives I've tried. I hope this is still in development. Please keep up the great work.,1,0,0,1,15442

It's a great app  but only problem is it does not synchronized applications that you have installed through bar code for easy retrieval. Once you loose the company app code you have a hard time retrieving it especially when you need the code also to gain access to the account on the third-party website and no proper support is provided to disable two-way authentication. example: I can't access my teamviewer anymore because I reinstalled google authenticator and it's asking for code which I can't get on the site without providing security code from Google authenticator.

1. threatened squares: Displays the status of each piece on the board. A red square means that the piece is under attack and not sufficiently defended  or that it is being attacked by a piece of lesser value. This is usually a pretty serious danger signal and means you must take active measures to avoid losing a piece. Yellow means that the piece is under attack  but it is just sufficiently defended. You must be careful about removing any defending piece. Green means the piece has enemy contact but is well defended. Usually it is okay to remove a defending piece. 2.

The app will not open a database file stored on external sd card (and instead of saying so  it gives the scary error message that the file is not a database). Once I copied the database to internal memory  it opened without any problem. User interface could use lots of improvement. Have to use PgUp and PgDn buttons instead of scrolling through all records in a table (looks like this is implemented this way for quickness when browsing through large tables). No pinch-to-zoom in or out. Ability to execute native sqlite dot commands (like .dump and .schema) would be a big improvement.

Nice  clean and simple MAL client. Something Dreadful has created Something Awesome. Sync is fast for me  (wifi  40mbit)  no startup issues on Android 5.0.2. Only one suggestion so far: Add a +1 button to the anime tile instead of in a submenu  and change the sub menu button for +1 to the dialogue to change the watch count and status. In my case  as I update MAL not every watched EP i'd have to tap+slide trough roughly 5 screens to get to the watch status and EP count  which IMO should be easier to reach. Also  maybe a feature request system in-app with a list of requests and request progress if being worked on  and a vote system could help for either only the beta  or both beta and release version.,1,1,1,0,60146
Disappointing. It's a great idea in theory (worthy of 5 stars); wonderful if it actually worked for me.

***WARNING: THIS APP HAS KNOWN VULNERABILITIES AND HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED IN OVER TWO YEARS*** This was a great system when it was regularly updated. However  it hasn't been updated in over 2 years. OpenKeychain is a fork of APG that is much more currently updated. I have switched to that system. Changing over k9mail is pretty straightforward; the crypto provider just needs to be set to OpenKeychain in each account. Don't get me wrong. I loved its seamless integration with k9mail. It's just that I need something that isn't going to be full of vulnerabilities because of simple lack of updates. APG paved the way  but it seems someone else needs to take the torch (and OpenKeychain seems to have done it).,0,0,0,1,15739
This is a GREAT app. I have been using it for YEARS already on all my vehicles. Very user friendly and easy to use. With the stats  plots and logs  it shows you everything. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star rating  is the fact that it does not auto backup to either Google drive or any cloud storage for that matter. This means that after putting fuel in my vehicles  I have to back it up every time. I did once all my vehicles data  due to not backing it up  and then my phone broke  and had no way to retrieve the data.

Allow to only download headers; again like default email app. 3. Allow emails to Not be synced/stored on phone. Especially when setup as an IMAP connection.,1,1,1,1,279304
This truly is a great RPG game at it's core. Simple  yet difficult. It's D&D. Which is great. Although at times the Hit Chance seems to take a mind of it's own (89%? No I think there is a decimal point missing there...8.9 sounds more correct with my playthrough haha) The only gripe I have at the moment is that gold is really hard to come by. Loot is worth nothing and healing items are impossibly expensive. Would it be possible to add (Or maybe it's there and I can't find it?) a way to actually cook the meat that we find as loot? It's the only way I can see that I 'm going to be able to actually finish this quest. Monsters get far too strong far too fast and without money I can't get past it.,0,0,0,1,2717

Thank you for the app  will donate and rate 5* if some of below are implemented!! *UpdatedSuggestions: black theme option  mark as read icon on bottom corner or by swiping up from view mode (eye) icon  swipe right on article list to bring in entries list into view. So instead to star/mark as unread you can have it so we tap the top right or left corner of an article in article list. Mark as read on scroll. Tap and hold article in the list to open it in browser.

Really like the app  but the only problem I have is that it seems with certain apps that Simple Gallery can't be used as an image selection tool. In particular  trying to use Simple Gallery when using the SD Card option in the Album Art Grabber app results in it just bringing up the regular viewing gallery when you open an image rather than selecting that image to be used Edit: Didn't expect to see such a fast response! I'm not sure if it's limited to just that app or it would happen with other apps as well. Glad to hear you'll try and fix it though Edit 2: The only issue I had with the app was fixed  and with speed that I haven't seen elsewhere  thank you! Changed my rating to 5 stars :),0,1,1,1,65461

However  I checked today  and for I don't even know how long  months  it has been backing up only MY sent texts  not my received texts. So  wtf. There's no point even in having this is it doesn't even back up the received messages. That's the only reason I needed it. I need those received texts and now I have none. If I could give zero stars I would. I'm furious. There has to be a way to retrieve those messages. It went somewhere!!

"CycleStreets is a journey planner for bicycles - with options between from Quietest to Fastest.

What an app! I knew what I wanted to achieve when I set out looking for IP cameras initially but thought we would have problems with firewalls in the office and then someone recommended this. Can't find anything that hasn't been covered by the author  everything I can think I'd want it to do has already been thought of - including Dropbox upload  auto-restart  motion detection  etc.! And the suggestion to use partially working phones is precisely what I had in mind (as we sell phones and have some with faulty earpieces or partly cracked glass). Best of all  it's free - would have paid for this functionality as it saves me buying an IP camera(s) and the time and grief of configuring it.,0,1,1,0,8605

Exactly what I was looking for Really like this music player and the smooth UI. Widget is nice and clean and loving that the player supports album art which you can easily download from the web through the player itself. No lagging between songs either which amazed me when streaming over slow mobile data :) Unfortunately when streaming music from Dropbox  if the player hasn't cached the song and you try to add album art or modify the title in the library  it crashes :( Prolly need to stream all songs first and then start modifying those little details in the library.. Otherwise a really good app  smooth and clean. Hoping development continues to make this the next big music player ;),0,1,1,1,17661

I backed up my database to an SD card like it says to.When I got a new phone and transferred the settings over  the database I'd spent so long creating was gone. I tried to restore from the SD card.

This is a very useful application with only a couple of problems. First off  it needs to give the option to click on a contact name when starting a new message conversation. It is very annoying to have to manually enter a phone number that already exists in your contact list. Secondly  it needs to give the option to attach files not just access the gallery. I prefer personally to attach photos directly from my file manager and it will not allow for this. Other than that it is a very useful application. I love the dark and app and black themes period I am legally blind so having a dark theme is a must. It really helps being able to see it and the adjustable fonts are helpful as well.,0,1,1,1,158309

I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4  and like a lot of other people  the app crashes on trying to load a game and returns to the home screen.

For me  in this kind of tool a more minimalist design as the old one work better. But besides that  it is perfect. EDIT to answer the dev: I find hard to put the exact words about what of the new UI feel off in comparison of the older UI. But i would say that everything take more screen space now (the buttons  the title banner of each tab)  the older squares on each section of a page made better to localize the settings to change.

Top notch  exactly what the Pixel C was missing I just got this app about a week ago or so and boy have I been missing out.

This app is part of the Android Core System Google apps and some non-Google apps require it to run. It is a combination of shared code and background services. A service is an app or process that runs in the background without creating a user Interface also called an activity. The problem with Google play services is that it tends to pick up a lot of data and for an older  smaller device this consumes a lot of the /data partition which prior to Android 4.4 was fixed to a relatively small area. In Android 4.4 and higher the user memory is part of /data and the boundary between /data/ and /sdcard was mounted under /data creating a movable boundry. This gave apps more room.,0,1,0,0,210947
love having a command line-like launcher and its features. used nova launcher prime for years  found t-ui a half hour ago  and im never going back. already uninstalled nova. one small issue  however.. i cannot save the tui settings file. all i want is full screen  no notification  and to change my user name and then my phone will be absolutely perfect. will donate once i figure out how to save settings. edit: downloaded version 5.2 and used the native txt editor. it worked! full screen works! changed the user name and device name! disabled the notification! my phone is so sexy now! donated a few bucks  everyone else should do the same. the dev deserves it. thx Francesco!,1,1,0,1,71668
"Simple  very FAST  & efficient. So far  it's my favorite gallery app. After the initial load (I have over 2 000 pics)  the app is very quick in viewing all pics for each album. You can change the background colors  increase the # of columns  move pics from internal to external memory  and when you edit a photo  it displays instantly in albums (unlike some other apps). Also  there are no ads. I only wish that the """"edit photos"""" button was one click away with a button on the bottom right of the screen (rather than 2 presses on the top right since I have a big phone)  but that's not a big problem for such a quick loading app. Thank you for creating such an awesome gallery!",1,1,0,1,65285

"Great app  and top marks to the guys developing and maintaining it.

The entire functionality of the Kiwix app relies on the ability to load external files (in .zim format) that you download separately. As such  you would think that the app would give you the ability to select a .zim file to load  but the app completely lacks any file selection dialog. I've downloaded multiple .zim files to try  but I can't select any of them in the app  so the app is essentially functionless. EDIT: Your response that you're surprised that search failed  and the solution to is to search again  complete ignores the actual problem. I don't NEED to search at all. I know where the file is. Why does the app completely lack the functionality to SELECT A FILE?!,0,1,1,0,131385
Note 3 problems I have an intermittent problem when I am listening to NPR on my Samsung Note 3. The taskbar flashes blue  and if I turn the screen off and turn it back on  I can use my phone for a brief second without unlocking it  but then I cannot actually unlock it. Sometimes the problem stops if I'm patient  other times I have to use my moment of usability to restart. So far I have not had any similar problems in other apps  so I think it is probably the NPR app. I'm going to give the app 1 star because I am forced to give a rating to post the review and I want the creators of the app to take notice. In actuality  besides the bug I'm experiencing  it is a great app.,0,1,1,1,162539

The best image and video viewer I have come across. It shows and plays videos and still images as they come  one after the other  while other viewers show either images or videos separately  out of context. The app even exhibits file names on top of the thumbnails  so you know what you are watching. I would be happier if it could show .PDFs as well (like IrfanView for Windows)  and also allow viewing the files backed up in Google Photos. Right now Google Photos is just like a garbage dump  with images and videos separated from each other in great confusion and without the option to sort files by name or date. It seems to me that you could bring some order to that mess.,1,0,1,1,65378
Been looking for something to launch and connect my phone to my Acura TLX. Tried a few then found this. Overall it works  but when connected to th car it takes over your phone so if I need to get into phone the hime button does not work  I have to hit the back button and apps button. If it did not make the phone difficult to use while running this app is great  but it is too frustrating to get to email or any other app while this is running and connected to car. July 2016 update: Upped the rating because I was in car mode. The app is pretty good  although the disconnect wifi feature is not working.

Ye I get it 2 factor auth is supposed to be bound to a specific device. But no backup feature means you are seriously boned if anything happens. Get Authy or Auth Plus  anything but this. Or if rooted you could use Titanium (or manually backup the App settings) but why  just why? Which brings me to another point. On a rooted device this PoS is absolutely NOT secure. The settings are not encrypted at all  they basically assume your phone is secure which Google obviously knows isn't always true  not to mention that they have no control over that. Well done Google  wanna be secure when its inconvenient for the user but too lazy to encrypt what you are trying to protect.,1,0,0,0,280302
"Out of all the games that have been released for Android  I find myself mostly returning to my SNES emulator and SCUMMVM!

Works Great App works well with rtl-sdr usb dongle except that it has a much more restricted freq range than a competitors app with the same dongle. Possibly a user error. Ie can not tune below 24Mhz. Get out of range error. Hoping this is user error as the support and upgrade path from this dev appears to be much better than competitors app. UPDATE: After response from Dev. it appears that the app is correct the tuner in my dongle has a24MHz lower limit  The competitors app appears to tune much lower ( doesn't throw error and has signals) but it is not actually tuning lower. After purchase support for this app is superb. Can't wait for future updates. Thank You,0,1,0,1,64
Awesome app! This is very helpful to me! It's only missing a few things. Fish locations outside Quest rewards sections  and I need to know locations of items you cannot buy or gather in Quests. Like  certain Trader item byproducts  what items to have the Trader get for you that has that byproduct item as a rare bonus  and tell me which items can only be obtained from Meownster Hunter rare areas. I need that added  as I have to resort to Monster Hunter Reddit  since most of the info not in this app is not on Kiranico  the number one place to look for Monster Hunter info for a few Monster Hunter games.

"The app looks great  however if you try to skip the beginning inviting you download a map of the place it thinks you're at  you won't be able to see any map.

It just freezes all the time now. When it wasn't freezing  i wanted to use it to free up space on the phone  but since downloaded files remain on the phone forever  it is pointless.

I don't get the feature which lets me automatically upload photos  which takes twice the amount of space and every photo on the gallery is duplicated. Very annoying.

The best book collection app I have found Excellent  well thought out app with no nasty catches  it does it all without restrictions - add by by scanning barcodes  or enter ISBN.

Sync to goodreads and Library Thing too.

This is a great monthly widget. Import/export doesn't really backup the categories or their settings. It imported some data but changed the times  off by an hour. First Monday of every month is No Parking on my side of the street because of the street cleaner. Hefty $50 fine if you are parked there from 8am to 2pm. The import changed all the times to 7am to 1pm on all my events. Not very reliable as a real calendar but makes a great looking widget.

Great app. If you like Facebook messenger  then then you will love this app also. All the benefits and the best one is it isn't tied to Facebook. I only wish it would be able to access my Google photos to be able to send photos from there also. It doesn't replace your texting app. It is a stand alone app messenging. Exactly what I was looking for. The perfect Facebook messenger app replacement. Also it works simultaneously across all devices if logged into the same account. Again  only thing it is missing is access to google photos which could allow more photos to be shared within this app and you wouldn't have to have all photos locally stored on the device.,1,0,0,1,153664
i'd like to think that an easier way could be worked out  but the app does work as described. How many steps there are to complete the setup would be good information up front. For me  the first two codes too about 10 minutes to arrive. since I was expecting them immediately  I did the 3rd one  which worked. The one issue that I have is how to get to the message then back to the screen where it should be entered. I did it  but it was quite clumsy. It would be great if the code could show itself on the page that's already there. There are a couple of weak spots in either my understanding of how it's done or the coder's planning  but this is a well working app.,1,1,0,1,281367
I've used this app with great results on all my past devices  but now I have the GS6 that has an octa-core processor  though it's really 2 linked quad cores that perform different tasks  with supposedly only one of the quads ever running at one time. I figured I'd see how this app interprets the gs6 hardware since it only supports up to 4 cores  and while it only shows 4 cores with the app open  I was surprised to find in the notification pull-down shade it shows 8 real-time % readings. While the readings seem to mirror the cpu process load  I have no idea how accurate it is. I would love to see an update to this app cause it really is well done otherwise.,0,0,1,1,18270

Better than WhatsApp  more features than Signal. The easy way to explain this app is to say  it's similar to WhatsApp  but looks better  is quicker. It also works great alongside the Desktop version  which works on it's own! Signal and WhatsApp both have to connect to your phone which makes it slow and unreliable. It also has lots more features  so many small things that add up to one great experience. It's also open source! The Encryption has been debated by Signal users time and time again  but Signal doesn't have the feature set Telegram does  and Telegram has yet to be hacked so there's that.

The journalism is fantastic. Very middle-of-the-road. The articles are informative and compact. However I would recommend a few things 1) Modernize the app's look. The app looks like they haven't updated it since 2010 2) Do more international stories. The stories are very US-centric (Yes I know NPR is an publically-run American enterprise  but the BBC is a publically-run British enterprise and half of their stories are about international affairs) 3) Remove that ugly radio button at the bottom of the screen. Just have a radio section in the menu! (These are just my opinions and do not reflect the opinions of other reviewers on the Play Store or elsewhere),0,0,0,1,163400

Great app I like it a lot and I like the integration with goodreads and LibraryThing. I was able to import quite a few books effortlessly by adding my amazon purchase history via goodreads. What I don't like much  but perhaps it's not the app at fault  is that when synchronizing with goodreads not all book cover thumbnails are imported  so some covers that display no problem in goodreads end up with a blank cover in the app. I could of course import manually image files for the covers or snap a picture  but it sounds like a waste of time given the api in theory would allow to import them all (unless there are licensing issues with some ?),1,1,0,1,158813
Google Authenticator popularized two-step authentication all over the Internet  and for that alone it deserves a lot of credit. It has numerous shortcomings  however. The user interface is poor -- account names and the timer animation are too small to see comfortably. There is no PIN  which could have been used to store the secret keys encrypted. If somebody steals your phone  they can extract all the secrets from the phone's flash memory. There is no way to back up secrets or transfer them to a second device. Even though I use Google Authenticator all the time  I do so only because there is no good equivalent and trustworthy replacement.,1,0,0,1,281890

Excellent App for Nexus 7 Eventually found this app after trying and rejecting many other catalogue apps. Functionality was exactly what I needed. Interface was reasonably intuitive (to an android/touch screen newbie!). A key requirement was to be able to export/import book data. This was achievable by means of a file management application (to get the file back onto the Nexus  which has no micro SD card) and an appropriately formatted CSV file. Note that Excel cannot format the file correctly  but LibreCalc can. Only thing I couldn't fathom out was how to get the same book onto multiple shelves.

good but a little frustrating: monsters move way too fast! Whether or not you attack or are attacked makes a big difference. Using arrow keys to move is nice  but doesn't allow diagonal.

Please fix the app. I enjoy using this app very much and use it regularly for every single initial query I make about any subject. Nearly every subject I look up is covered and many are covered in extreme depth. The apps features mostly all work fine. I have noticed a tendency to crash when too many tabs are opened simultaneously or when hopping from hyperlink to hyperlink. However  the single biggest flaw is the reading list feature. Not only does it usually crash every time I try to create one but it also won't let me log in. So I can't edit anything  contribute anything or save any reading lists.

Vim Touch is an Android port of Vim  and it works very closely like Vim on desktop computers. There are some additional features and UI layouts that make using Vim on a mobile platform easier to use  with visual buttons and shortcuts to make editing on a touchscreen or small device more usable. Other than that  it's Vim all the way down with the typical features to expect from Vim being included here.

One bug I've found is after software update I lose settings like recording my track to gpx etc. I'm also trying to figure out how to add red light cameras for the community to see. Apparently this is done through openstreemap dot org and is a more complicated process than it sounds. So for this I still use WAZE when in the car and OSMand+ for cycling or motorcycling where reception can be shotty.,0,1,0,1,173195

Wicked home screen replacement on a laptop running android_x86. Not quite so sure of how much it adds to my Chromebook but will leave it installed and see if I make much use of it. Will be buying the donate version. Would like to see a few more refinements....so hopefully development is still ongoing. 1) Some control of transparency and text colour in the search box. Light theme with transparency does not have good readability as it stands. 2) Widget list with a bit more info on which widget is which for apps with multiple widgets. 3) Some option to further categorise apps. I guess expandable folders.....,1,0,0,1,285085
How people rate this app so highly is beyond me. This is simply one of the most awful apps out there. The interface is muddled and feels like an alpha. Going to admin is just a browser window that doesn't work as well as your browser. It has quite possibly the worst editor I've ever seen. You're better off just logging in with a browser than wasting your time on this. This is a half baked broken app. It's a good thing they don't force Android users to use the app like Evernote does  because this is atrocious. Just log in with your browser and use the web interface because its infinitely better than this.,0,0,1,1,85159
[SOLVED] Broken root call for hiding the icon. Broken request for the root function to hide the status bar icon. It's annoying as hell and if I have the root I can obviously see the logs.Seems like Roundr has a broken call function for the root on SuperSU. Fix it and this small app will be great. Until then  I'm rating 4 stars cause of this nuance. Will write to you on XDA so you can see if everything is ok with code or it's my setup to blame.

Amazing  and I mean amazing(!) app if rooted. Still somewhat useful  (even if not) 4.4 KitKat and later OS KitKat and later reduced the utility of this app almost indescribably: If not routed now  you are seeing less than a tenth of what this app can do. Still  even now  unlike most great  pre-KK system diagnostic apps that are barely usable  it is still useful for sleep to awake tracking and list of system processes. If you're rooted  it's the holy grail of power leach finders: it gets right to the heart of the issue  and fast. No significant battery load either. If rooted  it is an absolute must have.,0,1,0,1,25921

Excellent Concept App I would like to congratulate the developer to come out with such an excellent concept to explore the contents of the storage. I recently bought Google Nexus 7  32GB 3g/4G which got automatically upgraded to Kitkat 4.4.2 OS.

This is a pure Linux Terminal This goes to the heart of Linux. If you HAVE root you can add commands with symbolic links to busybox or toolbox. Simply make a symbolic link the busybox or toolbox binary and give it the name of the command you want to add. ln - s cp busybox in the directory where busybox is creates the cp command. ln -s mkdir toolbox in the directory where toolbox is creates the mkdir command. (Note: Not all commands are supported so it doesn't always work.) (Note2: Symbolic links are not supported by the filesystem on the user's sdcard. If they were you could make symbolic links there.),1,0,0,0,19270
Finally decided to dump Hangouts for Telegram. I like most of it. There are a few annoyances. Some which developers have no plans to work on. I do not like the emoji.

But there are a lot of things that Telegram gets right. It is available on all platforms. It's fast. It's smooth. It does not consume much RAM on the desktop. It just works great.

This is easily the best app search tool I have found. Admittedly  all it really does is take the Search Apps textbox and repackages it into a simple icon and adds some features  but that is very handy. It offers a simple user experience. It displays and searches through all the apps on your device. It can be set to launch apps automatically. And it closes automatically once you've opened an app (i.e. it doesn't continue to run in the background). There is no lag  and there are no ads. This is as close to using a folderless system for apps as you can get. And I almost forgot to mention  it's very FAST.,1,0,0,0,43319

Great app  with lots of information other versions of apps with the same name do not have. For example connection speed in Mbps and estimated distance  which is remarkable accurate. Suggestions for improvement: Make it easier to switch between 2.4 and 5 GHz  which is now hidden in the settings. I think this should be more like a tab or a switch in the menu itself. Another suggestion is to show more information on the connected accesspoint after clicking on it. e.g. SSID hidden  DHCP details (incl IPv6)   802.11 standard used (like 802.11ac)  latency and whether or not it is connected to the internet.,1,0,1,1,46879

Wow! This on my phone. This answers questions that people should be asking before buying a WiFi router or access point  and during the setup/confirmation process of said devices.

So far  best out of 7 apps I've tried First week on android and I've tried multiple apps to switch from iReader - FBReader is so far the best. I can organize my library on my SD card  add tags  edit book titles  control the screen brightness... awesome! One thing I am missing is to be able to add bookmarks quickly (e.g. quick tap on the top right corner) instead of going to menu  add bookmarks  add new bookmark. Just a tad annoying. Overall  I love this app so far and will be more than happy to get the full version  to support the team  but will give the free version a spin for another few weeks.,0,0,0,1,287816
New material design version is fantastic! Looks great and fixed the constant server errors too! I have used Transdrone for some time now  but it was always frustrating because of constant server error messages  and then when really bad  it would take a bit of juggling wifi on and off and force stopping the app to get it to connect again. Since the update to the new material design version  I've not once had a server error message--not even when batch deleting a bunch of torrents (which used to cause server errors almost every time). And on top of the functionality  the new interface is fantastic!,0,1,1,1,116952

Strage issue started today on Nexus 5 This widget has been working great for the last two weeks  but today it's behaving strangely. It's giving me 0-200mAh while charging by USB  and 400-600mAh when unplugged. It should be the opposite...... This just started today  and I haven't changed anything. Very confused. Also the DashClock extension doesn't update automatically as far as I can tell  so it's kind of useless in that sense. Giving 4 stars based on accurate past performance but the widget but no auto-update on the DashClock extension  but I hope this new issue gets cleared up soon.,1,1,1,1,796
I like the keyboard as I can type Bangla  English and Arabic with this single app. The only thing I would love it to have is a rich Arabic word prediction which is lacking in this keyboard. I used to use Swiftkey which has a very good Arabic word prediction feature. Is there a way I can manually add a list of words from a file? If not  please try to add it in the next update. Another thing you can try updating is  sliding on the spacebar to change language rather than long pressing it and then selecting it from list of keyboards. It will save time while working on different languages.,1,0,0,1,110875

200+ hours played  loved the variety with all subclasses and weapon/spell archetypes. Better than any PC roguelikes I've seen. Superb work. Just one suggestion: the wands of transfusion and regrowth feel like they probably shouldn't be in the game. I understand their uselessness adds excitement to getting the other wands by contrast  but if they can be reworked into wands that are actually useful even in niche cases it'd probably improve game quality overall.

Good  but needs filtering options Works really well  but is a bit annoying how it lumps in composers  conductors and bands (orchestras) in with the Artists.

Really angry at this. So my phone needed to be reset. It was crashing every two seconds. I reset it. I imagined since it was a Google App that my accounts and authenticator was syncing to Google so if I reinstalled everything would be there including the programs I was using 2-step for. I reinstalled and all is gone and a couple of programs I used cannot be recovered and are asking me to create a new account. This is upsetting. Going back to 2-step with phone. Find that to be superior since if I lose my phone I will still be able to recover my account by transferring the number.,0,1,0,0,279686
Not a terrible app  but I want more so I uninstalled. You can't preview songs before downloading  doesn't have much old music I'm looking for.

Other than having Chromecast support this app doesn't appear better in any way than free alternatives like Ultrasonic. The UI is clunky and the Chromecast-support has so many bugs. To name a few the volume controls never seem to work while casting and if you stop a song and close the app to cast from another app  this app will try to reconnect to Chromecast and override whatever other app you tried to cast from which is really annoying. Even if you stop the current song and kill the app after casting the next time you start the app it'll automatically try to start Casting again.,0,1,1,1,173620
Good app that could become great with minor changes This app does exactly what it advertises and I have been very happy with the results. It took a few tries changing the settings to get the best results and good battery life. A new feature I would suggest is having the ability to save settings profiles. For example so I could save settings that would log slower for when I hike verse logging faster for when I am cycling or in a car.

Great game with a few app problems The game is actually fantastic  however  I have been running into some issues since the UI update (sometime around summer 2013).

Going back from that to the home screen will (after a few times) eventually cause the app to close and be able to be re-opened to the start screen with the game lost.

Does the job with some good options  and I can appreciate the option in settings to ignore certain apps for scrobbling  but it doesn't always work. I use Pulsar+ and Podkicker Pro for music and podcasts  respectively. Pulsar+ is listed an an option to disable scrobbling for  but Podkicker Pro does not show up as something to disable scrobbling for  so I always get podcasts in my last.fm list  which I don't want.

One of the best. One minor thing keeping it from being perfect. After trying all of the bubble level apps that don't require permissions this was one of the best. No ads  no permissions  incredibly small footprint  responsive and easy to read display  able to separately calibrate each side...The only problem is that it's too easy to hit the calibrate button. All it takes is a quick tap and whatever side you were working on will be off until you can find a perfectly level surface again. Hold for 3 seconds to calibrate would be better. Still better than anything else tho,0,1,1,1,62219
The app is excellent. Could you please add a feature to put privacy on a user's Profile Pic? So that only my contacts can see my Profile Pic if I choose to do so.

Worked just fine for a long time until now and made me almost buy a new phone I used this app for a long time on my Asus Zenfone 5. About 1 month ago  mostly right after unlocking the screen and sometimes randomly  the display tilts/shifts with an absurd angle and goes grayscale and then shortly after phone freezes  makes me do a hard reset. I thought it was a phone problem because I hadn't installed a new app. But then I thought maybe it's about this app  because it happened mostly after unlocking. So i disabled it and the problem solved. Hope this gets fixed. Cheers,1,1,0,1,27910

A firewall by nature should not connect to anything I don't want to connect to. This connects to ad networks I don't want to connect to  making it a bad firewall. I refuse to donate to the app or purchase any features while it has the ability to connect to ad networks. Reply: Not being able to block connections makes it a bad firewall  a poor rating is not unfair. If you have to make your app bad to be viable  so be it. But I will still rate it by its quality. A bad app is still a bad app  even if it is better than no app. My rating can't be for only the paid version.,1,0,1,1,96621
Update is a disaster Well  the new update has cured my Shortyz crossword addiction. I LOVED this app but they have sacrificed everything to some designer's aesthetic.

Excellent app that works very well. Totally free with no ads. Running Moto G3 with marshmallow 6.0 this app works very well. It has separate volume presets for media  alarm  notif  and call. It toggles the volumes when the Bluetooth is connected or disconnected to allow you to have special settings to work with your device and return to normal status afterwards. This helped me to improve weak call volume settings in my speakerphone . As a bonus this app even turns on Pandora. Note that this is not a volume booster. It can only go to max volume.

After fiddling with it  including finally force closing it & deleting its data  it's finally showing things accurately when I first open the app. It used to start with things showing as they'd be at the following day's sunset. The only real issue I see left is that it tries to scroll/pan diagonally when I roll my phone(horizontal orient) to look up/down or turn left/right. It corrects itself  I think due to the magnetic correction setting  but it's pretty annoying because it makes things EXTRA shaky. :/,0,1,1,0,166587

UPDATED...Still new to this  so will rate again  but... UPDATED: Having to uninstall  sadly  because it crashes every time I try to open messaging. Not uninstalling for that alone - that's kind of the last straw. PREVIOUS 3 stars  So far I like the idea and intent  but like some others have mentioned  push notifications would be great.

Amazing application! Has greatly improved productivity on my Pixel-C. Two suggestions to implement if possible: 1. Ability to show only running apps (i.e. those seen once you hit the overview/app switcher softkey) and not all recent apps (when I close an app usually done with it  so not needed in the taskbar even if I had it open recently) 2. Ability to change icons in task bar manually instead of applying a whole icon pack (I am very picky about my icons and change them all individually). Keep up the great work  this app is indispensable to tablet users!,0,0,0,1,284982
5+ gigabyte data usage in one day? I unknowingly ran through 2/3 of my monthly mobile data plan allowance in a matter of hours by running this software. I had a similar subsonic app on my iPhone and never had anywhere close to that much data usage. Did it try to download my whole library in the background? Seems to me like a major bug/issue. I used the default settings  so I'm not aware of doing anything wrong on my end... Update: I looked in my server logs and found one track being requested from the server over and over (and many many times per minute).,1,1,0,1,16566

Thanks for your latest update (Nov. 2014). This app has many great features  and we appreciate your continous improvements. One bug from this last update was fixed as I was writing this - fast work! Now  if you can just make the in-app keyboard better  I will happily give you 5 stars. I have small hands and fingers  but still miss the correct letter as often as I hit it.

Great for use with custody defense in court! I often communicate with my ex-husband about our daughter via text message and his responses to my texts are often ignored  replied to vaguely  blatantly disregarded or in a very negatively  when it involves something important about our child  her health  or safety. Many of his texts are self incriminating & so I have continued to use this app as I am able to print out the texs & use them towards my case for obtaining full custody when presented to the judge & can also used with/CPS or for a TPO! #Amazing,0,0,0,1,23252

Fantastic idea  but needs a little polishing I'm on a 5.7in note 4 and the tweet box you type in is bugged. It cuts off the top half of the letters  and the second line only comes into full view when you get half way across it. I would suggest bringing the whole box down maybe 5% so the top bar doesnt intrude. Also theres an issue with force closing when you tap the app when its been open in the background. To beat it ive to open running apps and go in that way otherwise i just start it again once it closed. Plus i would make the tweet button larger.,0,1,1,0,19110
Great app! The only issue I have with it (and it's a BIG downfall) is that it doesn't calculate or log your average fuel mileage if you don't fill your tank completely. So if you put only $20 in fuel in here and there or have a gas can and put some fuel in your tank but it isn't full  it doesn't log your mileage. Even though all the math is there (it asks for litres  your odometer  and your fuel tank size) so it should be able to  but it doesn't even if you filled your tank during your last trip to the gas station... correct this for 5 star review :),1,1,1,1,18513

Finally a Calendar app without unnecessary permissions and sync features  which means that this app won't connect to the Internet at all. It's 100% offline. I've tried many calendars without using their sync features but they kept nagging me to set up syncing  which is very annoying. But then I found Simple Calendar.

Should be amazing but fails. They also have FAKE reviews posted. This could be something great but a lack of development makes it WORTHLESS. Judging by the forum this app has been dormant for at least 4 years. The game play is immediately repetitive. Seriously its all the same forest. Leveling up is FLAWED and skewed. I played for an hour to hit level 6. Yet on the skill menu which has 20+ skills listed i was unable to increase any of them. There is no base increase upon level up.

Seems useful for some people  but there's a bug in the only functionality I need for mobile Viewing issues in a repository and filtering by milestone. It keeps saying there are no open issues for a milestone when I try to filter by that milestone - for each milestone. And I know there are issues for two reasons 1) when I view all open issues I can see that they're assigned to specific milestones  2) when i view in GitHub I can see lists of issues per milestone. This is the only functionality I need on mobile so the app is basically useless to me.,0,1,0,0,67499
Extremely laggy on One Plus 3 using Marshmellow This app doesn't work at all on my new One Plus 3 phone running Android Marshmellow. The moment you open the app you are in a lag hell. The app lags through camera not the phone. EDIT: I fixed this problem by disabling that experimental camera2 setting (which was enabled by default). Things work better now but I haven't found any option to set custom resolution for selfie cam. Also the sound on snap needs to be able to be silent. Other than that good app  raised my rating but it's still not a 5 yet.,0,1,1,1,169842

This has been an amazing app to use. It keeps my wifi off unless I'm in an area it remembers. I have had some small issues in the city where it picks up different towers at the same location and as a result turns off my wifi in my apartment. That being said the configuration is super easy so adding a new tower to my safe list is a breeze. I'll probably have to cut down my usage of the app because I'm switching to Project Fi but I suggest this app to anyone out there looking to add a little extra security and probably some battery life.

I wanted to like this.

LG Mach  ICS 4.04: Great utility made even better Excellent for learning choral music on-the-go  without the weight of my book  with a good stereo headset---also works great piped through speakers at home.

Surprisingly smooth! But don't exit... It does skip often but never to the point where it's unplayable and the sound never skips. One big complaint is that if I press the home or multitasking buttons on my phone by accident  the game will be closed once you go back into the app  which is devastating when you haven't saved.

0.4.1 broke the game - rating accordingly The previous update already had the balance doing a clumsy routine on a tightrope  while this one completely broke the game. Armor is now basically useless  with the first boss consistently doing 12+ damage in one hit through a leather+1 armor.

Great tool for comparing chargers  USB cable  & apps to see where your power is going to. Crashing my tablet and causing a restart when trying to graph 765000 log entries. It that gets fixed  it'll be a solid 5-star app! I've found Micro-USB chargers ranging from 80-1400 milli-amps (not all were designed for my tablet  but what the hell...). If you use micro-USB chargers (with detachable cables)   use the shortest cable possible  as I've seen that account for a 4x difference in milli-amp charging current (10 foot cable verses a 3 inch cable).,0,1,1,1,769

Ringdroid performance Well to say as much as possible without chatting it up  I've been downloading music from my phone since I was 12 years old  and texting was just becoming a normal thing. With that said I'm now 28 years of age and this was the first ringtone making app I ever downloaded  and I haven't changed since! Over 15 years of me using this particular app  and I've yet to run into a problem! This is by far the best application hands down!

Amazingly Fun and Challenging Game! If you like roguelikes then this game is a must-have for you. There are a ton of interlocking mechanics that make this game very unique. As the description states  this game is very difficult and luck-based. I have never won a single run yet although I've played over 100 games; I barely made it to the final boss once on my best run. To succeed in Pixel Dungeon you'll need a decent understanding of the game's mechanics  good resource management  and luck. All in all  this game is amazing! Can only recommend!,0,0,0,1,41184
Was an awesome app b4 fb api change Now the app is useless like many others but I still will not nor ever download the fb native app until they actually make it work better than using the browser. I think we should start a class action against fb. Only reason they changed the api is so that we as users would have to log into our accounts to do anything and hence falsely increase their user stats for ad revenue like how many ads am I really going to see if I log in just to check friend bdays for the day in notifications instead of using an app,1,0,1,1,111740
Like it so geeky. Need some improvements too. AM USING CM11 ON GT-I9082 AND THIS MAKE SOME REAL DIFFERENCE.

Small in size and great for free time fun! Great game if you want to have some fun in spare time and don't want to give up much memory. No story  just go and explore.

I have been using this app for a few years now with no trouble using it until today. My galaxy S3 required a factory reset so I made a backup to my pc. When I moved it back and subsequently tried to login to my old database  the app tells me Invalid Password. *UPDATE* I resolved it by uploading my backed up database from my pc to my dropbox  fresh installed UPM  told UPM to sync database from my dropbox. Somehow that was different than dragging the database from my pc to phone  but hopefully this helps someone. Score changed back to 5 Stars.,1,0,1,0,1050
I've decided to look for an alternative to Minecraft ever since some...monetization decisions regarding handling of user-created content. I think I've found what I've been looking for which is this game. What I love about this game is the customizability this offers in terms of modding. I had lots of fun trying to pick out mods to install in this game to tweak this game to my liking and I guess this is the charm of Minetest. My only minor gripe for this game so far is the d-pad being kinda small  and there needs to be an option to resize it.,0,0,0,1,134045
Would be 5 star  but can't post pics. I've been using this app for a few years. It was fantastic!! That is  until I got a new phone with updated android.

Another example of a great app that is getting worse and worse.

Eliminate the notification pop-up I loved this app as a replacement to my stock LG G5 texting app. However  there does not seem to be an option to disable the notification pop-ups. This is my first non-Samsung phone since the S1  so adjusting to a new phone has proven to be very difficult. All I need is an all-black theme and background in order to save battery power (which this app does have)  and non-intrusive notifications without pop-ups in my face  the latter of which has failed miserably.

Homescreen Works Great  Wear Needs Work Very enjoyable app. New wallpapers every so often are very refreshing. However I would like to see some better controls and settings for the Android wear portion. For example  I wish I could change the font or use an analog face.

Love this app  but functionality limited by Android L I've loved this app for years  and with the new export and import features it's incredible. Have donated in appreciation. Only remaining request would be the ability to clone/copy profile. Sadly though  there is no way to maintain my original profile of having vibrate off but volume at 10%.

Small  efficient  and very useful I started using this app way back on my Google G1.

It didn't yet have the ability to pull down attachments in MMS messages. To be honest  I didn't care because there was nothing else like this and it has only gotten better since.

Very good  but a work in progress. The settings and features in AcDisplay are adequate  or more than enough for many users. However  the lockscreen beta feature needs a lot of work (I've sent an email regarding some possible fixes). The app itself is basic  and allows everyone to get the most out of it  while it's functions are very aesthetically pleasing. Also  there is a very short delay between the lock screen activating and the screen turning off  which might be noticed by a few people  although most wouldn't figure it out very quickly.,1,0,0,1,27520
My favourite podcast app  and I have tried many! I tried a lot of others since Google abandoned thier Listen app and this is the best replacement in my opinion. Nice looking  functional interface. All the queueing  playback  and download options I need. You can automate downloads for each subscription. Queue playback settings help avoid accidental deletion or skipping.

Unlike their competitor(s)  Telegram allows users to use their accounts on multiple devices simultaneously  which increases efficiency in work  play and whatnot. Telegram also allows users to change themes  which is one of my favourite options  alongside many others such as secret chats  etc. There's many more advantages than disadvantages that I can see in Telegram. Overall  it's the best communication app in terms of simplicity and ease of usage. Hopefully  more languages will be supported in the near future (e.g. Mandarin Chinese  etc.).,1,0,0,1,148975
Good Idea. At first I gave a low score because I couldn't add content  just view. After being informed that I must be doing something wrong  I realized that some things can be added on the go.

Amazing emulator  I'd never thought I'd never thought the day would come where I can boot up any Dreamcast game in the go. The emulator works very well and so far I have not seen it bog down.

Fantastic app. One little request My only wish is engine time limit in lightbulb mode to save battery. To me 2-3 seconds is usually enough  anything more is a waste of power. I constantly have to switch analysis on/off which is annoying esp. that it also removes the arrows and the engine output.

Handy for Gms and players alike. Probably the best app for Pathfinder general use. With bookmarks for making quick sheets for spells  feats  and everything in between  it's great for those who can't afford $40 per rule book.

I wish spells had more ways to be sorted through  but they are alphabetically listed for each class. If you want a better app for spells  the Pathfinder grimoire compliments this app very well,1,0,0,1,68210
Go to Bible app on every device This is a great  light weight app. Bibles & materials must be downloaded in app but a huge public domain collection is available. The most resources are in English but Bibles are offered in an amazing amount of languages. Backed up bookmarks  etc. need a file explorer to handle if you are transferring across devices. (use some automated setup to sync by home or cloud then manually restore backup & you'll keep reading & notes in sync across devices) Menu is a little confusing & odd but works well.

On LGG4 w/Lollipop 5.1. It has a lot of potential. Like others  I've found several bugs that compromise security. I am sure developer will update soon. One recommendation: it would be great if the lockscreen option would actually lock phone after a set lock timer  then a numerical code  pattern code or tap code (LG G4) could be used to unlock after swiping the AcDisplay screen. For periods of time under the lock timer  the screen would simply timeout and as usual and user would be able to wake the phone by swiping on the AcDisplay screen.,1,1,0,1,28788
"Really liking it Just downloaded this app so I'll change the review if my opinion changes but so far I realty love it. I especially like the widgets that are easy to check off.

Makes Facebook a usable proposition The app is itself just a wrapper for the browser based Facebook but integrates everything nicely and works rather well considering. Dev if you could add the following that would be amazing. Longer pre-loaded news feed so you could choose to pre-load say 10 pages instead of waiting for the load at the bottom of each segment. A way to permanently select most recent  it defaults back to the lame top stories every so often. Also the news feed will occasionally lose it's permission if you interact on a post.,1,0,1,0,20325

Gotta say  I expected a lot better After reading reviews and internet articles everyone seemed to agree this was the go to battery app. I couldn't disagree more. The navigation inside the app is terrible. UI feels unfinished. Everything is done via drop down menus. No gestures  side drawers or tabs. Lack of visuals make massive amounts of text info an extreme eye sore. Graphs are minimal and largely unhelpful. Overall  not an inviting app by any means. Make good use of the20 min refund period as there is NO free version of this available.,1,0,0,1,25832
I like the the overall design of the app and the controls it has. However with the firewall enabled I am seeing a little over 100mbps download speeds on my tablet and phone. When the firewall is off I get 245mbps download speeds. While I expect some performance hit when using a firewall I don't expect more than a 50% hit. I have it on a Samsung S7 phone and a Samsung SM-T700 tablet. Turning off the Filter traffic option took care of the performance issue so I changed my review to 5 stars. Thank you to the developer for the quick response.,0,1,1,1,96618
Poor quality and not for the faint of heart The only available dream cast emulator and it seems as though the only way to get it to work is to enter some dark pact. I get that they cannot off the bios but it'd be nice if they had a folder already created with the correct places for the bios so I don't have to do all the leg work (apps are supposed to make life easy).

I Love VI  but this has a bad bug It's nice to have the best editor on Android  and it's nice to know the developer fixes things even before I finish writing a poor review. I'm changing mine. This is still a bit confusing to use  but that's because I'm a keyboard person  and since the Hacker's Keyboard doesn't seem to solve all the issues  I'm giving it 4 stars for now. As things get fixed  that could change. Stay tuned. Edit: 3 stars because the copy/paste register just deleted a big edit I was making  and the original edit was also lost,1,1,1,1,36496
Love it  keep up the good work! There is enough customization for me. The biggest reason I use this is the alphabetical vertical app menu. Changed from cyanogenmod to Lg G5's stock  needed something similiar. Only thing there is - sometimes when some application updates  it gets another icon in my app menu  its like two shortcuts next to each other. Pressing the wrong one just tells that the app isnt installed. To fix this  I have to delete data/cache of this launcher  but then I lose settings. Any fix for that?

Exactly what I was looking for: 5 stars I've enjoyed playing this as a board game for many years  and I've always wanted to find a mobile version to play with friends. The only other version I found was fine  but only offered up to a 9 by 9 board. You could  however  pay $2.00 to play on up to 13 by 13  which was pretty reasonable. This version  on the other hand  offers plenty of settings  such as timed games  online play  a simple computer opponent  and a board size anywhere from 4 by 4 to 30 by 30  and it's free to boot. Perfect score.,1,0,1,0,5931
Good app  keep improving it please The new look is fantastic! Nice job. Withholding that last star for collection editing. :) The app makes reading forums and seeing my collection very phone friendly. I would like to be able to add to and edit my collection though.

Needs to nail the basics first. Good app  but can't start Kodi  or control system wide volume on Win10. When YouTube videos to Kodi  it will not open the stream (or do anything) in certain conditions. Eg. It only works if Kodi is idle AND if the Kore app has been recently closed/hasn't been used for anything yet. It also doesn't prompt for the right HTPC to send to  which means that if the wrong one was selected previously  you need to select the right HTPC  then force close the Kore app  and only then will it work. Look forward to a fix!,0,0,1,1,49165
(for the Reddit plugin) So close... I was able to reproduce the multireddit I wanted to manually entering all 20 subreddits  which was a pain  but they stuck. After an hour  the wallpaper (which was set to cycle every 5 minutes) hadn't changed. I had to load the app twice before it pulled another one (edit: then 5 mins later it reverted to the first wallpaper). Double-tapping on the wallpaper is supposed to bring it into focus  but doesn't seem to do anything. Also swiping panes on my start screen doesn't pan the wallpaper like it should.,1,0,1,1,30070
What a difference an update makes... For awhile  ConnectBot had fallen behind.. No updates  dubious behavior with Bluetooth keyboards and some unusual ui quirks..

Easy to get started with great options- I really like this app because it allows me to edit posts when off line  putting changes through when logged into a network. However  it seems to not keep in sync with work done on my desk top. Logged into my desk top or portable device will get me different results  even though both should be synced  that shouldn't matter  right-of both devices go on line and are edited on the same account? I'm pretty sure that I've been saving my changes. Anyhow  thank you for this application. I like the themes.,1,0,1,1,85362
This thing is FANTASTIC for tablets  even without freeform window mode. Just the fact that there's a taskbar at the bottom makes multitasking a lot faster than having to constantly go into recent apps or exit to the homescreen to switch apps. One thing that would make it perfect (unless I missed it in the settings and you can already do it) would be to block off that portion of the screen  effectively using it as a navigation bar with apps. Being able to close it with the keyboard is almost as good though  but that would make it perfect.,0,0,0,1,285123

This app has potential but has a long way to go.

Awesome  Black Loading Screen. The BLACK Loading Screen at start up goes away after about 10 seconds for all those people that think it's broken. Works like a dream I love DOTT and it works as it should. My only thought is fixing the touch screen interface  I have read a few reviews and some people say it's there under audio  however on my HTC ONE I don't have this option so on a smaller android screen it would work better as opposed to the drag and click mouse style that is currently implemented.

Great emulator  looks promising The thing most people fail to realize is emulators take some time to get working well  especially on a new platform like Android. Dreamcast in particular has always been hard to emulate  even on PCs. That said  Reicast looks to be very promising and is already running many games at a good speed.

Calls are surprisingly clear and low letency  at least on the same network. Requires some reading to really get how each option works.

Pretty awesome..missing two things Finds and opens nds files well.

Excellent and very flexible app Great help on the site. I would like to ask the developer to add the the following about the Process tab to online Help: 1) to switch from Advanced mode to Basic  you need to go to any other tab and back  or press Back 2) to kill a process in Advanced mode you need to press on the garbage can icon - it will turn into X icon  then select the processes by clicking on them  then press on the X icon 3) to sort the processes - switch to Advanced mode - press on the histogram icon - select the desired criterion,0,0,0,1,65738

Does only what it's supposed to do Free. Source code is available (it's a pretty easy read  if you're inclined). Small  simple program without bloat and unnecessary permissions. Simple light  nothing more. An immensely popular flashlight app installation was probably the straw that broke the camel's back when I used Android years back. I had handsets hijacked in spectacular fashion  and apparently that was (is?) typical of these stupid flashlight apps. Don't trust me  Google Android flashlight malware or somesuch.

Minimalistic - but not perfect. Ac display is fantastic and goes extremely well with my launcher on my LG Leon. But every app can be improved. Some improvements that I'd recommend is attempting to remove the constant ac bar notification. Annoying for some android users but nothing too major. Last but not least  I really hope to see different security locks like  a pin number  enter a pattern or swipe to unlock. That has been a very wanted feature with this app and I hope the devs/dev add this in a future update  but for right now. Great,1,0,0,1,27897
Another cool advantage of Telegram is how much they make it easier to develop and launch a bot on the platform. Unlike Facebook that requires to go trough an arduous approval and testing process  developers can test their bot ideas on real users - as long as they meet minimum requirements.

Superb! Great Job by the Developer!!! This is a unique and an only app on the play store which gives you the option to choose 'WCDMA PREFERRED'. The benefit here is it always chooses the 3G network only if it is strong else it hooks on to the 2G network. This helps me to use 3G internet without having to get out of network since it immediately chooses 2G network if 3G is weaker. I have also observed that If you choose WCDMA Preferred and if you make a call then it chooses 2G network automatically and gets back to 3G after the call ends.,0,0,0,1,18752

Great app  especially if you like your wallpapers to cycle. I actually don't use the wallpapers included with Muzei.

It just doesn't seem to work  I frequently lose my lists. And I've only ever used two Samsung Note devices over the past two years. To at least somewhat alleviate that issue  sync should be activated automatically and login as well as sync status should be visible while surfing (almost) any Wikipedia page / content  not just under Settings.,1,1,0,0,107238

Absolutely Best Camera ever!! I can't believe what this camera is capable of!! I use this everyday for work. There are two levels to this camera app. Level one is same as all the rest but a little better. Level two is for anyone that changes settings. Extraordinary!! The Camera will imprint a logo on picture your words/font/ color. Before my pictures always needed to be cropped. Now the item is framed automatically. I never need to crop anymore. So amazing. There is a compass feature this shows the cameras alignment to item. Best A++,1,0,0,0,168972

Great free/ open source/uncluttered program Great program - free  open source  uncluttered and does the job. One small feature request that  of course doesn't diminish the above  but would be highly sensible and  judging from discussions online  there seems to be philosophical resistance to considering unfortunately- in particular. some podcast subscriptions  such as planet money  sometimes require manual download of a podcast; would be very helpful if these could be organized in and played and kept track of from the program as well.,1,0,0,1,114804
Pretty good  and worth downloading. Considering so few have managed to develop decent Nintendo DS series emulators - on smartphones/tablets OR computers - this is actually a pretty good effort! The interface is great and whilst there is a little bit of sluggishness  the most recent update ensures that most games are playable  even with the sound on (which doesn't seem to affect the performance too much). All that's needed is a little more tweaking for smoother gameplay and this would be perfect... I used Pok?mon Black for my testing.,0,0,0,1,118851
Great content  sub part execution. When selecting a podcast you are able to look through a limited offering at first with the ability to click a button on the bottom to show more episodes. However  when you go to add more episodes all it does is append the same list staring with the most recent episode to the bottom of the previous list infinitely. Also  when you make a Playlist of episodes the app will appear to let you move the order by letting you drag an episode to a new spot but when you attempt to drop it the app moves it back.,0,0,1,1,163116

WARNING: Data Hog - My phone's data usage has gone through the roof during periods when I barely listen to 3 different songs.

Find another messaging app. The inability to disable the camera preview when the attached menu is open is absolutely unacceptable.

Loved it!! Almost perfect I had decided to switch from the old tasks app by TeamTasks and was looking for an alternative. This one had similar UI to that app and had a lot of additional customizable features which made this app much more useful. My only problem with this app is that while setting reminders  it requires 2 additional taps if you want to enter a custom time on a custom date. Few other apps as well as the old tasks app combined the date shortcuts & date selection option to one screen thus not needing the additional taps,1,1,0,1,98480

How fast can you multiply? In all practicality  of what use is this app as it is currently structured? It provides 4 simultaneous bar graphs representing the duty-cycle of processor cycles utilized in each core. Great!

Updates kind of ruined it I used to love this icon pack  it was simple and colorful. Then a month or so you introduced the white borders around apps  and now colored masks. For me the white was already a step in the wrong direction because it made the non themed apps really stick out  and the new masks amplify this to the point that it completely ruins the look for me.

Not bad but could be better No bugs  just missing an important feature. Pressing calibrate just zeros the level - poor!

Fantastic Chiptune Player I've tried many chip tune players for android and while some of them support one or two formats that Xmp does not  they pale in comparison. Xmp's channel view is particularly awesome; you can see the currently playing waveform for each channel and each can be singled out or muted individually (surprisingly uncommon among android chip players). The instrument names are displayed front and centre (great for those chipper's notes). The developer is great too; very responsive and accommodating. Simply fantastic,0,0,0,1,72679

No toolbar on the bottom please The version before this one was great. Android has an overflow button and the hamburger menu and it worked great for wikipedia.

Needs 2 things for perfection It's very simple to use and overall I love the app. It needs to have a way to link the data to google drive (or dropboox  skydrive  etc) for automatic backup. The manual backup and reinstall approach went out in the 90s. Get with it! There should also be an option to print the log directly. That is a huge shortcoming!

I remember it being so much better Still neat  but issues. It won't find my location even after I grant the app location permission. I had to go in to the permission settings manually.

Decent app with room for improvement. Hi devs  would just like to thank you for the brilliant work on the app. However  two things that could perhaps be improved on - 1. positive and negative values for the charge so that it's clear if your phone is currently charging or discharging. 2. perhaps the app could detect what phone you are and automatically input the arithmetic operation function? Also  if you do see this  can I just check that for the HTC One (M7)  the arithmetic operation to use is - divide by 1 000? Thanks a lot devs!,1,0,0,1,747

This game encapsulates the middle finger attitude that so many new-school  easy-mode  hold-my-hand baby-gamers have long since either forgotten about or never experienced. This game is a true challenge. Frustrating? Yes. Unfair? It certainly can be. But is it fun? Oh hell yes. This game makes you cry and rage but that makes the good runs all the better.

Works when tweaked properly: I had to keep tweaking settings for it to work well. Galaxy S7 Edge is my example. There are hella choices for rendering options and more.

I agree whole-heartedly with reviewer Amiris Brown that this application should never integrate Google Calendars except potentially as an *optional* add-on. I also agree with their thought that it would be nice to have holidays added; however  I feel this should also be an optional add-on  and should offer as great a variety of world holidays as possible  as well as moon phases.

I've really liked it so far! I like the visual customizations  I've never seen an app that lets you customize even the app icon. That being said  it has crashed quite a few times. It also does have a few behaviors that aren't like normal apps  such as double tapping on a message from the lock screen doesn't bring you straight to the message. It just brings you to where you were in the app  which may have been a different message thread. So overall I like it  but the crashing has been just enough to drive me to find a different app.,0,1,0,1,158322
Keep Facebook away from your data  and your battery! This application is an indispensable asset if you want the convenience of using Facebook as a social media platform and messaging service without the worry of Facebook mining your phones location and browsing data. It also combines both Facebook functions into one easy to use (albeit crude) application. No bells and whistles here  but that's a good thing. This app also has the added benefit of being %100 battery friendly  whereas Facebook wakelocks your phone 30-40 times an hour.,0,0,0,1,20417
Newer Look Sucks  Older Versions More Intuitive I'm so glad I back up my apps!

Works on Android TV (Sony) Best OpenVPN Client on Android so far. Works on my Sony Android TV like native Apps. It is shown in the TVs App menu and is fully controllable by the TVs IR remote.

The one problem I have with this app so far is that the armor set builder isn't as flexible as it could be. I am currently unable to use a gunner helm on a blademaster set and vice versa. In addition  I am unable to mix low rank armor gear with high rank armor gear. Other than that  this app is great to use. Another recommendation I would have for this app is to add an achievements/awards page for some completionists. It's on Reddit,1,1,0,1,95963
Good application  but ... The app worked well for a bit until i had added 3 games to my collection  then i bwgan having trouble adding any other games to it. I could search and find the games i was looking for  but when navigating to the game to add it to my collection  the app would go to the game page  and then nothing would happen: no information about the game. Unfortunate  for managing my collection from my phone. Also the inability to add multiple games/expansions at the same time is an oversight to the apps functionality.,1,0,0,1,61278
big security flaw! read - v good app but does not clear the clipboard after copying a password! not even after the time delay is up or you lock your database - ppl can paste your last password again. do what i did - get tasker and set it to fill up the clipboard with some sentence that should clear it. you need x20+ different sentences or items to fill up the clipboard or get some app but test it actually clears the clipboard because the popular one I tested did not... best to be sure whatever you do... but its still a good app!,1,0,0,1,116162
WLANscanner sees more networks! Tried it head to head against WLANscanner and WiFi Analyzer. Matched WiFi Analyzer  but WLANscanner saw more and maintained more wireless networks and kept them in view (even the lower powered ones). I'll stick with WLANscanner. Also  screen utilization is off on this app. It regularly failed to utilize the full screen. And I'm not a fan of the squared off wireless signal peak representation. Just looks strange to me.

Excellent app  stop hating on this This app works very well for its purpose and deserves 5‚òÖ. If you don't wish to use it then it can be disabled on your device and will use zero RAM as it does not run  and you will never be asked yo update this app in the Play Store. The factory installed app base will still occupy &lt; 5 MB storage which is acceptable.

The best epub reader now with sync across devices and Calibre plug-in I've used FBReader for a few years and it has got better and better. It was already very neat app with good options for fonts  backlight  page turning  online stores and so on. Recently it gained Google Drive integration so you can keep your books synced across Android devices  and there is also available a Calibre plug-in so you can download from your desktop/laptop based Calibre library. FBReader now makes for a very good replacement for Amazon's Kindle app.,0,0,0,1,287662
This is a useless POS. The program might work  I'll never know because the documentation is appalling. If you already know the function names you can use the example function to discover the syntax. And if you don't  you can't. You can spend an hour or two trying to guess how to plot the graph of y=x^2 between -1 and +1 and get absolutely nowhere. Nothing in the manual gives you a clue. Like most free downloads  it's written by  and for  enthusiasts who are functionally illiterate in English and incapable of explaining anything.,0,0,1,1,32708
Want to use it more... I would use it WAY more if it had some triggering abilities to start/stop and upload automatically.

Make degradation a challenge? I've been playing this game since v0.3 (before enchanted items). It's always been my favorite app. I recommend it to everyone I know. That said  I am a bit disappointed with the degradation mechanics. Sure  they've improved  but they still interfere with a massive  fundamental part of the game- upgrades. If they were made a challenge  that would give those who actually enjoy degradation (if such people exist) to play with it enabled  and everyone else to play as we would prefer- with no degradation.,0,0,0,0,42679
Plagued by sync issues & bugs This app has improved since version 1.0 but still needs a lot of work. The latest version looks great with material design layouts but seems to give less information. Many things are just not accessible. The play logging is great but currently does not work since you can move to the next field. I do love how it gives you a notification at each game log telling you what number play you're at for the game. But what ruins the app are the syncing issues which are abundant and make the app often useless.,0,1,0,1,61050

Absolutely Appalling App Of all the apps I've downloaded through the years  this one has consistently been the absolute worst. Hands down. I can always count on it to just shut down in the middle of any given show I'm listening to. I love npr and listening to its podcasts while I'm driving but it's abysmal to be required to re-open and re-find my spot in a streaming podcast every time I'm listening to one.

So useful and so necessary! First  five stars because the app does exactly what the developer states that it will do and it's not missing any options that I would want. On top of the app working flawlessly  it's definitely helped me resolve one of the many pain points of upgrading to lollipop. I actually held off the the upgrade for some time because of the xposed modules I rely on  but through this app and others I'm finding alternative solutions to get most of the same functionality I had on 4.4.

Just plain doesn't work Over the years  this app has continued to get worse and worse. At his point  it basically doesn't work for streaming your favorite NPR station. When it. used to it streaming a specific program  it will skip backwards and repeat 1 minute segments at random. You're better off listening to the radio or streaming on your traditional computer or laptop.

No speed up any more I purchased this long ago for the speed up functionality and the author removed it on Lollipop. I recognize that he said it was buggy  but it worked fine for me and now this app is worthless unless I maintain an old version. An option to turn it off would have been far more reasonable.

Two irritating features 1. When I have it set to show notifications in status bar so I can pop back into it at a moment's notice.... That feature only works for one file at a time. If the next episode plays automatically  the icon in notifications disappears until I go in  uncheck  then recheck it. 2. It doesn't pull strm files from Kodi for upnp content.

Amazing companion to Kodi Kodi already has icing on the cake  so where does that leave Kore? Double icing baby. The ease of use and features make this a must-have when using Kodi.

Simple and to the point I just needed something to track habits per day and to be able to view it over a calendar period  with some simple yet informative analytics thrown in. This app does just that with no ads! This app is a win. One request to the developer is to include some form of sync / data backup (Android supports this natively now).

Great app... with a couple of issues Great app  though there are some things that I wish were different. I wish it worked in the Google Launcher on KitKat and Lollipop. I wish it worked consistently on Lollipop (the rounded corners come and go seemingly randomly). I realize that it can't be applied to the status bar  but if it at least worked on the bottom corners I think the GEL would look better. Also if the rounding could be applied to popup boxes  such as the app drawer  that would be a great enhancement. Overall 4/5 stars!,1,1,1,1,7657
Immediately try this! So I was sceptical of this app. I'm no expert on Binaural beats or tones so I started off light with the sleep inducing track.

I didn't know that before the description of each track it tells you how long to use it to achieve the effect 1/3 of the way through my track and I feel tired and its only 10PM!

Couple of annoying things but still awesome On custom sentences and lines of text my biggest pet peeve twoards this app is the fact that in order for people to read it you have to type everything in reverse (od ot gniyonna steg yllaer ti)  it gets harder to read unlike Binary or Matrix  which is spaced out and leaves a letter in its space and produces the next one on the trail.

Some good and some bad Good: The game is very true to the rougelike genre and challenging  prepare for several doomed first attempts and to learn from your mistakes in order to progress. Random dungeon generation makes repeat plays fresh and is very repayable. Bad: The randomness of weapon/armor drops make it difficult to get past some of the early stages  especially if the ghost side quest provides minimal value.

I played my old Final Fantasy I with no problem except laggings when in map and the music is horrible. Now playing Final Fantasy II and lags everytime  even the music sounds horrible. It used to be great until the emu only runs smoothly on games that are MORE than 100 mb. Like why? Will give the other stars once it is fixed.,0,1,1,1,53606
I've been tinkering around with this app  and I haven't even found all the features of it yet. but so far  it's exactly what I wanted' powerful  simple  and flexible. I got some clip on lenses  and was having trouble with the default camera app that came with me phone  because if it's auto focus. When I switched to this camera app  I was immediately pleased. and it continues to have powerful features I find I want more and more. serious kudos to the developer  who does not bombard with adverts  and delivers a very usable tool.,1,0,0,0,171588
Great practical features and manual controls but it wouldn't record video above 1080p30 on my ancient hardware (sic) of a Galaxy Note 4. The native camera shoots 1080p60 and 2160p30 but this Open Camera won't  despite being able to control the data rate up to 100Mbps. It does seem to allow unlimited recording time which would be valuable if it could record 1080p60  which is currently limited to a measley 10 minutes on the Note 4 native camera. If I could record for even 30 minutes at 1080p60 I'd be very happy with this camera.,1,0,1,1,172077
I Love NPR but this app is seriously flawed. The interface is great  I much prefer it to the iOS version  but the stories frequently fail to load and items on my playlists are often skipped over entirely. Probably most aggravating is the glitch that causes the next story in your queue to begin playing 30 or 40 seconds in (forcing you to go into your pocket  pull out your phone  open the app  and slide the playhead back to the beginning of the piece). Infuriating! I am definitely beginning to feel some Android buyers remorse...,0,1,0,1,163148
Great  basic application that does just what it says. Using my HX50V and basic Android phone  I can get 2-3 hours of shots before the camera battery dies. (Using an external battery pack would easily double the time.) My only complaint is it seems to miss lots of shots. For example  if you set the interval at 15s for one hour  you'd expect 240 shots. But I usually only end up with 100 or so and there are gaps of 3-5 minutes between some shots. No idea what causes it and would like to fix. Otherwise great and thanks to the dev!,0,0,0,1,282652
This is an excellent ebook reader which until recently rightly deserved five stars. Recent updates (starting from about 3 weeks ago) messed up device going to sleep after application exit. This is (obviously) connected to the app's setting controlling whether to force the display to stay on. When this setting is enabled  after exiting from the app the display stays on until the app is forcibly removed from memory (I forcibly stop it via the launcher). My phone uses Android 4.4.2. These problems never occurred until last month.,0,1,1,1,287178
Search feature works ok Only complaints: 1) The app won't quit! If I choose the option to exit the app it won't actually quit. When I use it I have to go into my app settings and force quit it. 2) When I open the menu or switch to a different screen  or pretty much do anything it lags to the point of freezing for a few seconds. 3) The option to upload an eBook to my kindle collection didn't work. After I tried to upload it now the file can't be opened at all. Before I tried to use that feature the file opened fine. Plz fix!!!!,1,0,0,0,122082
Beautiful simplicity I wish I had known this launcher earlier. I have tried almost all launchers in the Play Store. I couldn't settle with even the most elite launchers with loads of customization options. This one is simple yet beautiful. A simple command line interface seems to have hit the sweet spot against so many other effects-filled launchers. As someone else has written that its a huge sense of relief from GUI  transitions  widgets etc. Very true. The RAM usage on top is a good info. for the user. I wish there could be,1,0,0,1,71304

Streaming is troublesome Streaming will randomly stop when I hit my devices back button. The check box becomes unchecked as well  without user interaction.

Difficulty based on chance and obfuscation This game has every element that should make it good. Unfortunately there are several classic blunders that just make it missed the mark. Food is required  yet food is not plentiful within the dungeon. All items you pick up are unidentified the first time you see them yet you don't get enough ways to identify them short of using them and hoping. I suppose over time you would learn what all the items are  but if that's the intention what exactly is the point. It is a useless mechanic.,1,0,0,1,42156
Great when it works  but very inconsistent None of the toggles work consistently. The main on/off toggle never seems to do anything. I've had night mode working and not working with it in both states. The auto on/off functionality sometimes works at the appropriate times  but the corresponding toggle seems to work backwards when it does work. The tint and brightness functionality sometimes works  but the toggles interact with each other in bizarre ways  enabling or disabling each other.

It's actually pretty good  but.... The app is pretty awesome  but I've been having a delay in messaging. The message gets sent through just fine at my end but receiving at the other end can take anywhere between 2 minutes to two hours. There has even been instances of the delay being more than a day. My friend is almost always connected to his WiFi so I know that internet is not the issue as messages do go through other apps  just not this one. I hope that this will be something you take into consideration for a later update.,1,1,0,1,140681
Calm down everyone You mentioning the problems with the update is good but scolding the developers for your inconvenience is bad . This was a real time bug which the devs could not foresee . It happens and they are even sending updates for the past 2-3 days to solve it . Frankly I don't see a problem with the edit message update it saves a lot of idiotic messages sent by mistake. And yes even I lost fingerprint option   but they are actively solving it . Just calm down and let them do it without you hurling insults. Peace out,1,1,0,1,142720
Finally :) ok  gotta give this app 500000 out of 10. First app that I have used on Android that actually lived up to its description AND then some. I purchased a bluetooth keyboard for my tablet  and it's pathetic. doubles the keys  some dont even register  laggy.. but this app? one small telnet session? and it works! I was dubious. but it's great  and if only shift+arrow keys allowed you to copy individual letters out of text  it would be perfect. I am amazed this works so well  terminals are now a pleasure to use :) Cheers!,0,0,0,1,110617
Great email client I have used K9 for years  since my Galaxy S1 and now on my Google Pixel with Android 7.1. I did notice sync randomly being disabled on the new device and found this is due to doze (battery save) in the kernel. Once I removed the app from doze it now works great as usual and with three accounts that sync at 5 10 and 30 minute intervals only uses about 6‚ÑÖ battery life in a 14 hour period. I actively use K9 throughout the day to send mail as well  usually large mail with pictures. Best by far of all clients.,0,0,0,1,278858
Thank you Sky map devs :) When I first opened ver 1.9.2 the app seemed to be broken. It always showed me the nadir centered in the screen. I found that gyro is on by default but locating objects wasn't working if phones' auto rotate is OFF. When auto rotate is ON  the locating works but it gives me very shaky results. However  when I followed the advice of the sky map devs and disabled the gyro in the app options I found that locating objects works well and gives me smooth result regardless of the phones' auto rotate setting.,0,0,0,0,165569

This is a great diagnostic app! If you really want to know what is going on  and which apps are eating your battery for breakfast lunch and dinner when its only mid morning?

Highly recommend it. Quality game. The art is clean  informative  and uniform in style. The interface is intuitive and nonobtrusive. The gameplay is what you would expect from a rogue like; a challenging experience with variety and replayability.

There is obviously no tactile feedback on a touchscreen  which is why a gesture region should be MANDATORY; It's the next best thing  if not better  than tactile feedback. Having to look down at the remote to find the button to press is just flat out ridiculous.,1,0,0,0,49245
Just cancel the app I can see why this could exist  but just take it down. There are so many easy ways for criminals and people to get to the deep web which has a lot. of child porn  Illegal guns and drugs  ect. I know this because I found it.

Had it for 6 months and still love it I got this after one of my usual app downloading sprees  downloading all the top rated apps for what I was looking for. After a lot of trials I came to Dashclock. I use it exclusively now. The widget is great with the available extensions. I liked how simplistic the customizing was and how elegant the screensaver mode scrolls whatever you want accessibly and subtly. It's not that flashy  but it's function is great as a home screen or launcher and I like it's straightforward style. 5*****,0,0,1,1,159942

A Memory Card Program After about 2 years of use I can remember about 3000 words of italian. This only requires about 20 mins every morning. The app works very well  I can confirm that.

PC games for your mobile device If you enjoy classic PC games like the Monkey Island series  Kyrandia  or The 7th Guest  this is the emulator for you. Unlike DOSBox  SCUMMVM only emulates the functionality necessary to run your favorite games  and as such is able to do so much more faithfully. You'll need to download the correct plugins to add support for certain games or series. I suggest you only download the ones you plan to actually use. If you add more games later  then download the appropriate plugins as you need them.,0,0,0,1,174364

some debilitating quirks Erratic keyboard behavior. Sometimes the keyboard goes straight to insert  othertimes it doesn't. It's hard to know because the *insert* notification is inconsistent.

The best communication app so far Since Messenger recently had an update with the stories hype  my boyfriend and I decided to look for an app that will satisfy our needs for communication. Messenger turned to be a social media site rather than a communication app. Thanks to Telegram for solving our problems. I like the simple and fast interface. I also like that they use iPhone emojis  not the android ones or any default app emojis. The only thing I don't like about the app is the size of the text I'm typing. It's too big.,0,1,0,1,140263
Camera and video sending time! I don't know why it takes TWENTY MINUTES to send a two minute video! Especially when it only takes a FEW SECONDS on APPLE devices! Fix this!

Again  Apple devices do not have separate buttons. Lastly  videos should appear in the camera roll. Why they don't I have no idea!

Worth paying for I rarely  rarely spend money on apps because I haven't found many that are worth spending money on.

KeePass concern. Keepass copies the username and password to the clipboard  where it is then deleted after a few seconds. But Clipstack copies the clipboard thus providing a security problem.

Great until masks I appreciate the concept of adding masks and forcing circles to every icon  but frankly it looks terrible with certain apps.

So far so good  but... I just installed it today  so will need to see how it performs over time. I like that it is very intuitive. The only improvement I could see is if it were possible to have a habit frequency on more than once a day. For example  I want to use this to form the habit of taking several workout breaks throughout my work day  but I could only input each break as a separate habit.

The options and layout leave a lot to be desired though in my opinion  app needs to be simpler and going back and fro while searching for ROMs needs to be pleasant.

A perfect app Telegram: Telegram groups are ideal for sharing things with friends and family or collaboration in small teams. They can have up to 200 members  by default everyone can add new members and edit the name and group photo. Supergroups can have up to 5000 members. They have a unified history  so deleted messages will disappear for everyone  and ordinary members can only delete their own messages. Here‚Äôs some extra information on how supergroups work: - The entire message history is visible to new members that,0,0,0,0,141429
Having some problems Work about a few days now when I open up orbot it will load fully and says 100% but when I open orfox to check my connection it doesn't load and says problem with the proxy. Also when I look in the notifications bar orbot doesn't show any addresses it just shows 0kbps/0kbps. I really like orbot but I can't use it at all  and because orbot is acting up u can't use orfox. I'm not sure if there is something I'm doing wrong on my side. Is there anyway someone could help me? I would greatly appreciate it.,1,1,0,1,87182
Informative  sorta. It's a geek's tool that lets one see what is really using your battery. There's a bit of a learning curve to sort out what's what.

Simply awful. Tl;dr get PocketBook. FBreader is a sluggish reader. It requires a plugin to read pdf files  the documents list is awkward to use and doesn't remember the last location of the currently opened document. You have to navigate back to the folder if you are trying out a lot of ebooks. When zooming a page  navigating to the next page results in the view jumping to the portion that was previously outside the screen size.This is simply awful UX. A lot of functions have to be accessed by going into the menu.Quirky!,0,0,0,0,286466

Very Promising Hours upon hours of gameplay available. Wish it was easier to hit creatures though. Even with 133% hit chance I feel like I miss a third of the time. Also  put more details in our quest lot so we aren't having to take our own notes to keep up with the 10ish quest we have going on at the same time. Fix those two things and this game will probably be a 5 start. Also  please add the option to choose who you want to hit when you are in battle with multiple creatures. May discontinue play due to these problems.,1,1,1,1,3480
Best MHGen App Ever! I absolutely love this app. I would recommend this app to ANYONE who plays the game and takes it seriously. I would not have made it as far as I currently am without this app. There is only one small feature that I think a lot of users would enjoy. It would be cool if there was another main tab on the left that had a list of armor sets (full sets)  so that we could easily check the skills of each full set without having to add each piece manually in the Armor Set Builder. Still a great app though! :),1,0,0,1,96045
Nice  seems useful Two UI issues for me. First  there doesn't seem to be any way to sort events alphabetically. Secondly  the little 'i' buttons are very small  and right next to the invisible scroll bar (especially so in 'By Application' view with one app. expanded). This means it's hard to hit the 'i' and very easy to hit the scroll bar by mistake  and jump to somewhere completely different in the long list! Dev.  you could make the 'i' nearly 2x as big and it would still fit in the existing UI  and would help! Thanks!,1,1,0,1,8779
Unacceptably buggy Speech feedback frequently stutters or fails to work and sometimes plays audio through headphones and speakers. It also has trouble with volume  being much quieter than it should be. Perhaps the most frustrating part is trying to lower the notification shade. I frequently have to pull down on the shade 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or even 8 or 9 times before it descends fully. Of course I don't have a choice.

The app is free with no ads or limitations suckering people to donate  meaning that it is at our leisure and I love how this developer gets it. Second: No ROOT!!!! Love it. Third: I love the simplicity of the app and the ability to choose between flash and screen. In my case  I went with screen because my phone has no flash.

All my stars I've been using it over a year now. I have streamed music hundreds of miles over the internet using it in conjunction with SSH tunnelling.

Excellent customer support but app could definitely use some work. I recently had an issue but they helped me fix the it. I do have one request for the developers. It would be nice if I could edit my posts in more of a WYSIWYG way like on the website. Right now I have to edit the HTML to make changes which can be useful  but many times more of a hassle. It's also not user friendly for anyone who doesn't know HTML5. If you could add a visual mode to the app it would be useful. The in-app support chat is excellent though.,1,1,0,1,84948
Horrible pain to set up Please learn from Microsoft  their app and web tie in is seamless  super simple to set up and use.

It works but can be a pain Connecting the camera requires a switch of model a few times to get a solid connection. Once connected most is OK  the camera allows you control still to set the framing correct before starting the auto time lapse shutter. Main downside is  the app and phone need to be on for it to work  if the phone goes on standby  so does your time lapse.

Perfect for tracking I used this to track my travels through Morocco. It worked perfectly even without any cell or data service available. The interface is super intuitive. The only drawback I have noticed is the times displayed on import into Google Earth  but I'm not sure if that is an issue with Google Earth or the app. The times displayed are adjusted for the time zone difference so if it was noon in Morocco when I was doing something  the Google Earth display will show it as 4am.

One of the best I've downloaded 30-40 dungeon crawlers to my phone  and beside Pixel Dungeon (decidedly brilliant) this game ranks as the best I've played. The graphics are great  the storyline engaging  the monsters tough (when and where they are supposed to be...) And the rare items really are rare and often worth keeping.

As this info is already displayed with each repo  I'm surprised it's not already one of the filters. It would make a big difference to repo browsing.

Very Complex Even after reading the faqs and by setting mode of billing by trial and error  i am unable to get correct stats. This app needs a easier interface specially for dual sim phones. My operator charges my calls by per minute. For eg if i called someone for 30 seconds  i will be charged for 1 minute. If i call for 1 minute 12 sec  i will be charged for 2 minutes. Now tell me what settings i need to do under mode of billing or anywhere else  so that i can get correct minutes i got charged for. Will rate 5 after.,0,1,1,0,36033

Numerous Issues App lacks a lot of basics when trying to write a post (font alignment options and such) which is annoying. Push notifications have stopped working  even though I have them enabled in the settings. The app does not sync with anything done on another device (whether a pc or another mobile device) so I can't draft a post on my phone then do final editing and uploading on the computer or vice versea etc. So many little issues add up to an app that is a hassle to use rather than the convenience it should be.,1,1,0,0,84277
Convenient but poor UI Easy to get a lot of people to use from different platforms such as from iOS to Android to windows. However  Lots of wasted space   compared to IRC  chat rooms take up almost four times as much space  requiring a lot of scrolling. Picking a chat room or a private message is difficult because they're all grouped together and the order constantly shifts since it's sorted by last sent message. Security implementation is also less-than-ideal  requiring you to trust telegram to not read your messages.,0,0,0,1,142536
Perfect for teachers As a teacher I was finding it difficult to keep my personal books separated from the classroom books. This app has helped solve that problem. I've tried the scholastic app that is similar to this  but they were missing several of their own books on it. Since switching to this app I have found it easier to keep track of my personal books I have in the classroom for my students. I also like that you can add multiple copies of the same book to the library on the app. Another feature similar apps lack.,1,1,1,1,158791

Great so far! MvsC2 runs extremely well and looks about 95% free of glitches  and I added a 100% complete game .dci save that it loads. House of the Dead 2 will play  but is a little more glitchy. I was also able to add the 100% complete game .dci to it as well. This is a great app at this stage  can't wait to see it when it is nearly perfect.

Simple  clean interface and no ads! Checking the tick next to the habit in this app is a satisfying and motivating habit in itself (seeing your uninterrupted collection of daily ticks means you're less likely to break your habit). App opens and closes quickly and uses up very little memory. It provides a smooth user experience on my Moto G4 phone and there is no need to deal with annoying ads (completely ad-free!). I will continue using it on a daily basis in conjunction with a visual time management app (atimelogger).,0,0,0,1,284096
Best OTP app However  might I suggest a few features: add a way to sort entries  either alphabetically or most used on top. Because I got a long list of entries and the one I use the most happens to be at the bottom so I need to scroll down each time as it doesn't fit on the screen. Adding an option to have them show a code as I open the app so we don't need to tap the one we want. Last but not least would it be possible to add browser integration?

Disappointing I had high hopes for this app to learn Spanish. But extremely time-consuming and confusing to learn how to use. Terminology used is unclear  not user-friendly. Ex.: 'study' would be more clear  obvious and accurate than 'review'. Review means to see again. It implies the material has been seen before and is a more cursory exposure to the material. I also can't remember where various features are: must search endlessly. Too complicated to learn. Descriptions too technical nerdy.Optional pop-ups would help.,1,0,1,1,98032

Excellent App Out of all my 350+ apps  this one is my very favorite by far. I have tons of beautiful wallpapers from many sources downloaded. With this as my home screen  I can just sit & watch all the pretty wallpapers change every 15 seconds. This gives me a calm breather while I work with my other apps/tasks in between.

Haphazard and Crashy Very much Not the ES Explorer replacement I was looking for. Strange UI where you must scroll to the top of a listing to find the action buttons. Samba looses your directory position so you must renavigate. Lots of forced closes. Right now it has a notify that it is permanently stuck at about 25% copying a file.

I ADORE this app! 'Yay!' 1: I'm a fan of all things open-source. 'Yay!' 2: I've read that other apps have issues if you add too many books - I'm nearing 1 000 with no issues yet (Google Goggles sometimes hiccups). 'Yay!' 3: I love that it integrates w/GoodReads (GR) although I made the mistake of syncing w/GR once. Yikes. I couldn't roll back my changes (I didn't make a backup file before syncing) & 100s of books from my GR 'want to read' shelf pulled in. I had to start all over!

Does NOT support SPRINT. I'm not quite sure how this app can somehow NOT support one of the top 3 carriers in North America -- SPRINT -- but it does not. The app leads you to believe that this can be corrected by submitting your carrier's details  but this is a false hope. Have tried for months now to have Sprint added  without success. If the app's author would list a major detail like this in the app's documentaion (like not supporting specific major North American carriers)  it would be a very useful  helpful thing.,1,0,0,1,35877
Just a heads up for the uninformed This app can/does NOT hack Clash of Clans! If you put a specific IP address in a hosts file  it blocks the incoming connection from the specified IP (from everything I know  a lot). The reason you need root (also called superuser) is because the Hosts file is a SYSTEM file  so only root can modify it (sorta like when you open/run something  i.e. CMD as administrator on Windows). And to the people who are rooted but still have problems  make sure you have Busybox and SuperSU installed.,0,1,0,1,10171
Great app  takes a while to restore backup tho I've been using this app ever since I got my phone  and it's doing a great job. I use this before updating the ROM in my phone to preserve memories. One downside to using this is the performance of restoring backups. I have around 11k messages and restoring takes a couple of hours. I'm pretty sure it's not my internet connection  because it's the only thing running in my home and it only uses a small bandwidth. I'd rate this 5 stars if it's faster  heck I might even donate,0,0,1,1,21559
Loving it so far This is such an awesome app. It appears we can only place one widget on it though. Unless I'm missing something. Right now I have the flash light widget. It's nice to have fast access to it. The only thing that could make this better is being able to set the wallpaper to something other then our home screen wallpaper.

Useless and limited scan options Downloaded recommended Zxing scan app in order to scan titles to this app. Zxing doesn't work.

OPEN CAMRA (Mark Harman) I was searching for such an app because my stock camera records vedios with low voice. But this app provides to use different options to choose audio source and I found excellent recording of vedio with CLEAR AUDIO in three options like 'default  ext.mic and voice optimised.

Useless app I don't see the point of you installing this app why? because why would you need another app in order for your other apps to work and also this takes up so much space so much useless space that can be occupied by other apps that you need or want.

good and light but... This app is good and light  you don't have to install extra application on the PC  just using the telnet software from there  but  it would be great if the app able to cooperate with the existing selected keyboard input rather than we had to switch to this app input method everytime we want to type from a PC  and lastly  the latencies  I guess it can't be helped since this app only acted as some kind of a telnet server or something.

Amazing power and control The last camera app you will ever need! Phenomenal control of all aspects of taking pictures.

This app deserves a much higher rating! The performance of mobile twitter has had its share of ups & downs over time  but this app does exactly what it says it does.

Bloatware  spyware. Cut out the crap and give a version with basic functionality. Put your pryware and crap elsewhere. At least dump it off regularly and leave just necessary data in the caches for our apps. If not I expect a percentage of revenue off anything you plagiarised from my devices records. Otherwise expect much more competition and litigation.

Pretty good. Works pretty well  except for a couple issues. 1) Despite the option being selected in Settings  the play/pause controls do not persist when playback is paused for other audio. I also wish the controls persisted after playback is ended  so it is quicker to jump back into the app to select a new podcast. 2) sometimes the app glitches out  and plays the audio in the background  with no way to stop it. Press play/pause will result in two instenses of playback. I can't reproduce the issue  but it has occured.,1,1,0,1,114834

I don't get it Either I'm completely stupid or there's nothing to this app. It's like stripping the default Android notifications of all its usefulness  all its functionality  taking away anything that was intuitive about it  and replacing it with something in the beginning of its development phase which is so pointless that it may as well just be a picture.

Great Game I had never tried a rogue like game before Pixel Dungeon. At first it was extremely frustrating  but i think it was that challenge that motivated me to continue playing. Every time i would learn a little more and progress a little further. Some runs were just unluckier than others though.

Incredible One of the only actually free games on the market. Tons of fun to play and I love that I can play it with one hand. If there was anything that I would suggest changing it would be to make NPCs stand still because it sucks trying to get out of a building but getting trapped by an endless dialogue wall. Also maybe put a recommended level or difficulty level assigned to each area. Some other cool additions would be a crafting system like for potions and cooking meat  and showing which npcs have quests to give.,0,0,0,1,3425
Life saver I'd be lost without this. Backs up to my Gmail account and I organize the logs from there. This has been so helpful to me now more times than I can count - I've been able to bring in text logs and call logs to court with this app and they are accepted as evidence  and easier to acquire this way than trying to get them from your phone provider.

Would be five stars except.. I really like it overall but there are many times it won't open. Sometimes when it does open it doesn't show contacts  only numbers. Crashes a lot. For instance  whenever I try to delete something. No easy way (that I've seen) to just save a new number. Doesn't tell me when I get mms messages. It'll have a flag but won't wake up my phone or pop up as a notification if it's already awake. Received pictures show up in a crappy slideshow and are about a tenth of my screen. Can't send videos.,0,1,1,1,157915
Great app! The app is absolutely fantastic  especially when used with Kodibuntu on a computer with Ethernet. Works like a dream  would recommend to anyone willing to modernise their home entertainment center. All you need is an older PC and Kodibuntu and you're all set. Just two things I'd love to see in the app though: the ability to set the shutdown timer in the app itself and that when you select a song in the app it starts playing the album from there  not just the song and then it stops. Other than that: superb.,0,0,1,1,49128
Once I switched phones... Once I did that  I realized I was locked from my account on a website because IT ONLY RECOGNIZED THE KEYS FROM THE NOTE 4. When I switched to a NOTE 5  I thought maybe I could re-download it and Google would be cool with it and transfer data key from the other one  NOPE. Trying to get hold a hold of them for contact is ridiculously annoying as they don't have a customer chat bar. Don't know what number to call for this specific complaint and I can't point out online because it's not an icon.,1,0,0,0,281606
ALMOST perfect I use this app with the Crafty vaporizer device instead of the the official app made by s&h. PROS: I prefer this app because I find it to be simpler and more straight forward to use  it has all the same important features. It also gives the exact battery level (0%-100%) instead of the less exact official app which gives battery level in 20% increments. CONS: the only thing that I think must be added to this app are the vibration function controls and sound functions for the connected smartphone device.,1,0,0,0,109887
Searching On one of the older versions (or maybe it's my new phone?) When you would search  it would display at the bottom briefly how many results there were. This may seem superfluous to some  but with no way to tell how many results there are without dragging down the scrollbar and guessing... I used to use that to decide if a certain gimmick would work  or how many creatures were in a given creature type  etc. Some sort of x/y counter would work  or really  just put that little indicator back?

Since the update some of my words are typed twice when I press the space bar on my keyboard. It seems to happen at random but only happens in the WordPress app and only since the update. This is very irritating as I cannot get through a sentence without having to edit my typing. Also  it'd be great if posts didn't automatically try to refresh and only show the most recent few when I open the app as it makes it a pain to go back to older posts as I have to re-download them taking too much time and using too much data.,0,0,0,1,84566

I never regretted buying this app But the new user experience is a mess. Searching a street in a certain country does not work. This app has grown to have multiplied in features but has become complicated to use as a result. Further bugs have been introduced regarding storage.

Good App But... Thanks to the developer for the response  looking forward to an update with my requested features in the near future. I manage multiple wordpress blogs(more than 50).

A few flaws I don't have Internet connection outside of my house or school so I can only download music. I downloaded all the songs I want  but later  it would download the entire album depending on which song I downloaded so I had hundreds of songs in my playlist (which I cannot listen to for some reason).

Hands down the best messaging app. This is easily the best messaging app I've ever used. I have tried quite a few over the years. It really is noticeably faster than the others.

A great trip down memory lane I only wish it supported even more old school formats (Amiga custom  SID  SAP...) but that's probably not the goal of this app and it already has the most important ones.

Great but... This is one of my go to emu on android. The only problem w/ this is that some games ( AC3/SL/LR  BRS:TG  and VP:L) runs perfectly at start-up but ultimately fails by either freezing during gameplay  decreased FPS/spd until it stops  and/or lack of visual during combat/battle phase(but can still move  select  & atk).

Instead of going straight to an account's inbox it just goes to a list of folders instead which means an extra tap... An option would have been great for any UI changes.

Very good audio player This is a solid player that let's you access you or a friend's music collection on the go. Many great features.

Doesn't quite do what it says This app simply places filters over the screen. It doesn't drop the backlight  as my phone was using more power with the app running. Notice how non-rooted apps can't mess with the softkeys? That's why no matter how low the brightness drops with this app  they always stay the same brightness.

Extremely important core system app Whatever you do  please DON'T DEACTIVATE IT! Don't disable it  and don't clear its cache! It isn't draining your battery. Facebook app is. Messenger app is. Keeping Location Services on is. This app is required for the smooth running of your Android device  even if you've disabled most of the in-built Google apps. Almost ALL app processes and services are dependent on it in some way. Yes  it uses up around 260mb of internal storage  but its indispensable functions justifies that.,0,0,0,1,195131
Excellent except for... This is generally a very good app. Scanning of books is simple and when linked to Goodreads it really comes into its own. I used it lots and would have given it 5 stars. But there is no auto backup or option to sync your catalogue easily on to the cloud. As a result  should you have your phone stolen or upgraded or be forced to do a factory reset (thank you lollipop) then you will lose the entire lot!

The concept for this is without a doubt interesting. But since it's difficult for me to keep my mind from wondering  I have always had problems using this consistently.

Nice UI It doesnt work with the main email clients (which is their fault  but still a problem). The biggest issue i have is that it costantly tries to send my keychain to online keyservers. The default should be to keep them local  not upload my entire contacts list to public facing servers on the internet. The developer seems to think that signing is more important  or just as important  as encrypting. They are different operations with different purposes. They shouldnt be treated as incremental levels of security,1,1,0,0,131946
Buggy and annoying glitches The MMS stopped working shortly after installing the app. Countless bugs and glitches prevented me from truly liking this app. Maybe in a few years it will working perfectly  but for now I'd recommend steering clear of this app and find something else or sticking to the default on your phone.

Beware! This app has EVIL intentions I installed this app on a brand new phone so I could easily get into recovery to do firmware upgrade. The phone had no other apps than Facebook and WhatsApp. It didn't take long until my phone got hacked by this app and a third party app named recents.apk was installed that made new icon in my launcher with the google play icon and name.

Everything kills you There's a point where you realize  there's no way to win this game. Even if the dungeon is endless  there would be no way to find out if everything kills you by level 3.

Amazing results I seldom go out of my way to rate apps  but this one is truly outstanding! The map is accurate and as long as the phone location is turned on will reflect everything celestial there is to see in the sky. It even shows the correct location and phase of the moon. If it seems off and you use the android battery saver  make sure location is on (battery saver turns it off). You might have to restart the app after making that correction  but after you do  the map will be dead on. Absolutely love this app!,0,0,1,1,166281
Awesome app  gyro not good I loved this app! However  I noticed after recent updates (either app or Android system  not sure which) that the map is less accurate and very jumpy! I've used this app for awhile and loved it  but when I went to look for the recent meteor shower  it took me awhile to get it working  and it is still not steady and not very accurate. I am judging accuracy based on the moon's location  which is big and bright  but not write correct on the sky map! Please fix this  and I would give 5 stars!,0,0,1,1,165990
Useful but.... Ok this is a great app to play games but lets be honest about this. This still needs improvements like a fast forward button where you can speed up the text or whatever. Second  this app needs to save the games we play because once you uninstall this and reinstall it then the games you played and saved will be gone  bye bye. It would be good to have some features like the Gameboy emulator where when you uninstall that app it then saves your game data and then you can still continue where you left off,1,0,0,1,117317

Great crossword app While this app occasionally has issues it is one of the most used on my phone. It works well and has good clarity for the puzzles. From time to time some of the puzzles will stop downloading for a week or two but then they start up again. My guess is that this has more to do with the content providers than the app. My main issue with the app is that (at least on my device) once you start typing something you have to touch somewhere on the puzzle before you can use enter to move to the next clue.,0,1,1,1,120887
One of the best mobile games ever imo This game looks really simple and first you might think  that it'll get boring quickly. But NO. At the beginning it could be hard to beat the first boss at lvl 5. After a while  when you know nearly everything about the game  every play starts getting more individually and interesting. It's like chess. You do the same sh*t all the time  but every play is different. I suggest not to stop playing the game before playing 50 plays.

If you disable a cpu core  it will stop auto control it had before  meaning it will stay on or off constantly if you set it so. Before you mess with it  you could see it turning on or off randomly.

Almost  needs compact interface Works well  my suggestion would be to add a compact interface as a single torrent takes up way too much UI space on the overview.

Good but... Ok  the app is great. I really love it. The design and everything is perfect. It might be my phone  but when I open the side menu and I click on one of the options  it goes all white and it takes 5minutes to load the results. In the end  it doesn't even work. Same goes for the search. It wasn't doing this before so i doubt its my phone. I tried redownload the app and everything and the problem is still there. My lists are fine and everything linked to my account works great. I can't browse if you want,0,1,0,1,60207
Very good could be better. Needs more colours. Would be perfect if you could pick colours by code. I would also like if you could chose the size of the canvas. There's a few pros: The pen pressure sensitivity is the best I've seen but there's a lot of blotted areas which isn't too big of a problem. I also really enjoy the fact that you can choose the size of the tool by number. The app seems pretty easy to use overall. As an artist of several years (I've done lots of digital art) I see that this app has potential,1,1,0,1,9126
Like it but it wont color code The calendar layout is awesome but I am having a hard time with the fact that all of my calendar events are from the same google account  which only registers as 1 calendar color. I have multiple calendars from that Google account  but it all registers as from Google  not separate calendars. I need the contrasting colors for my brain to comprehend the different events that are happening throughout the week. Is there any way to allow users to choose what color each event shows up as?,0,0,1,1,32207
Need better testing on release. I use it for few years already. App eating my battery in 8 hours. The problem was with trash folder. Probably bad index after the update. It was impossible to just empy the trash. I delete few of them and finally was able to emty the folder. Developers tolerate deleting more than marking all messages as read. User can disable question for deleting  but not for marking them as read.:-? I use it as last operation after read some messages. The rest is ok with just reading the subject.,0,1,1,1,279086

Makes for a nice lock screen I know this application is all really about handling notifications and the lock screen is more of a side feature  but that's how I use it. The interface is very clean and simple but can also be customized with widgets. Corners can be assigned for phone or camera. It'd be nice to be able to launch any program. I love that you can interact with the normal android notification pull down while the screen is locked  to toggle the ringer or wifi. Memory usage is good  CPU is nil. Great job!,1,0,0,1,27950

Great tool I am somewhat new to flying. I got avare first and used on my Samsung. My cfi recommended forflight so I got a apple product and am using forflight now too. After using both I really like avare and it's free. The flight planning is easier in foreflight but can be done in avare. I like flying with avare better and have Geo referenced taxi diagrams for free. I can not comment on use for ifr but for vfr I feel that avare is fully capable app. The flight planning part was not as user friendly as foreflight,0,0,0,1,161095
Best aviation nav app out there  and free! Great app. Wish obstacles could still be highlighted on map view  or opt to place them on map view again. The 3D view is nice  but has never been an option for me since I fly around Bravo airspace and need to know detailed shelf/floors of airspace. A tile at the bottom of map view with a vertical view of upcoming (10-15nm) obstacles/terrain and airspace at that heading would help display that info. Overall this is an excellent app  and really can't be beat for the price.,1,0,0,1,161520
Notifications are weird I can't set it to where I only get an icon on the notification bar when I get message.

CONTROL TO THE USER A working solution to the problem of apps accessing servers without permission (can't be controlled through OS app permissions). Netguard has with success blocked the stock dialler from contacting Google with every call I make  to send that number to Google (a massive privacy breach in my op).

Overall I love the app and being able to listen to some of my favorite shows any time of day. The application itself is a bit clunky  I feel like I'm always fighting with it. In some situations it'll eat through my battery in a matter of hours even when the app is closed. I've taken to force stopping it anytime I close it down. There are also times when a show will get hung-up and refuse to play  only to randomly start playing over another app 30 minutes later. Despite all of that  it's probably my most used app.,0,0,1,1,162180
Works well  one usability issue I nearly dumped it as useless  because the reading did not change sign when going from discharging to charging. Then I discovered it changes the colour of the lightning icon instead - not what an engineer like me would expect. Now I know that I'm happy  and can find the optimum position on my various wireless chargers. I am marking it down one star because of that. Even changing the colour of the numbers would be better; Red for discharging and green for charging. Nexus 4  Kit Kat.,0,1,1,1,693
Pretty good! Been looking for a decent adblock browser. I think this might be it! Really like the clean interface. Really cool that you can turn off status bar.

It's great! But.. I used to love this app  but it no longer works. They made an update which requires you to wait through a long buffer period before you listen to a long ad each time you try to stream. After the ad  it makes a loud white noise sound and turns off automatically. I find that when I'm done using it  it continues to run in the background  thus draining my battery unless I remember to restart my phone. It would be nice if it could kill itself if not used after 15 mins or something if that's possible.,1,0,1,1,162649
Only a handful works The only games that seem to run well are power stone 1 and 2  trick style  jet set radio   anything else you download will be buggy or unplayable.

Having an issue I have been playing shattered pixel dungeon since it's inception. After a few months  I donated. Worth every penny. My issue is that since the newest update  after I kill a monster  the game thinks; freezing the game. But it's not totally frozen. I just can't move. It's like when you hold the button to rest. I can go to the menus  but I can't move and the circle is there near the upper left area below my picture.

I'm only using some of its features but... I don't care for live wallpaper generally and usually prefer my own downloaded images as wallpaper (non-scrolling).

Major bugs/shortcomings LG G4 Android 5.1 1) App always downloads a very abbreviated version of a spreadsheet instead of the full version. Most of my spreadsheets apparently are too big  but there seems no way to just load the full file as the default. 2) The description says it can edit a file  but I found no way to do this and I'm not the only person who has this problem according to their comments on Facebook.

Hmmm Huntress should NOT lose her Boomerang on death. Makes no sense since that is the main feature for that class. Also if you have an Ankh  why do you lose all your bags & equipment upon dying? Ankh should auto-rez you like the Dew Vial filling upon reaching 0 Health or let you pick up your old equip from your corpse since its still the same run. Makes having an Ankh almost useless if you have to build up your entire BP again with only 25 levels. Having a soft save ability at interval bosses would be nice also,1,0,0,1,41100

Love it! So far  so good. Just some minor things. The barcode scanner is a bit finicky. Also  when I search for a specific book by typing in the exact title and author  it will sometimes come up with a different book entirely sometimes not even the authors match so I'll have to go online to find the ISBN #.

Look up  spot the planet or star you want to identify  face your phone towards that part of the sky with the screen towards you... and everything is instantly identified on the screen.

Second row may or may not show up I enabled the second row. Sometimes it's there  sometimes it's gone.

The only slightly clunky thing now is that when you choose 'current location' as the starting point it starts you from the last place you centred yourself on the map - even hours ago. But still 5 points from me - I just have to remember to centre myself before planning a route.,0,0,1,1,165071
Well built but some issues exist! This browser proved extremely snappy and beautiful in my phone . Just to say I have a crappy device with a meagre 256 kb ram and 30 mb storage left . So I was searching for a browser like this. But the only reason for my unistall was that it crashes everytime I open the Google search . Or just search any thing . But websites like youtube and Facebook were running real smoothly. I swear this will be my permanent browser if u fix my issue. Atleast gimme a reason why its crashing!,0,1,0,1,14528
Pause button maybe? I'm using this app in combination with the desktop version. It's really great  but sometimes I simply don't have time to review everything I should review that day and then it piles up way too much. Would it maybe be possible to introduce some kind of a pause button so that the cards that should be reviewed don't pile up? I realize it doesn't make much sense to keep it paused for a long time  so maybe the function could be limited to a couple of days. Like this it's just too demotivating :-/,1,0,0,1,97863
What a Joke Having read many of the comments posted in the last two months and zero feedback/responses by Google I wonder why anyone would stick with Android if they had a choice? This app rendered my last phone inoperable and foolishly I applied the updates to my backup phone only to now understand the root cause of the problem was this app and this phone is on the same path to oblivion. Very poor show Google... Pitty you have bowed down to the pressures to monitor and report all to various government agencies,0,1,0,1,189874
Beastly! Thanks to this app  I no longer have to make my own reviews manually and cover the answer with my hand.

Didn't work for me. All it does is turn your wifi off and back on to reset it. Well guess what  I wouldn't be using a touch screen phone if I didn't have fingers for crying out loud ! Problem for reference: Galaxy S3 recently started losing connection if I moved more than 5-10 feet away from my router even with a very strong signal.

Good  but Could Be Better Don't get me wrong  I love this app wholeheartedly. It's an amazing resource while I'm playing. However  a few key functions are missing.

Secondly  being able to search through the monsters  armor  weapons  and skills like you can with the items would be much more efficient and convenient. Once again  this app is amazing  but it's not the best it could be as of yet.,1,0,0,1,40541
Almost perfect I love this app  and the fact that you can add multiple counters per project and have them reset is fantastic. The main reason why I didn't rate it a 5 is because there's no option (as far as I can tell) for reordering.

B.R.H. BEWARE! I installed this app because I thought I would be a good idea  wrong. I couldn't find a way to adjust it  so it turned my wifi off every 5 minutes.

The genre at its best With a simple and effective interface  this game  though tough at first  is a learning experience that draws the player back. Plus  it has constant updates to boot.

My fiance tried to get me to use this with my first Android phone  but I was too lazy. I finally put it on my first tablet  and was in love. It was le cr√©me de le cr√®me for several years.

Great game + great developer I love-love-love this game  but the fact the developer fixed a bug in less than 24 hours is amazing.

Great app just needs a few additions This is a fantastic app for someone coming from the Motorola ecosystem that misses the active display as badly as I did. There needs to be a way to swipe the media player out of the way to access the normal acdisplay screen.

Great clean simple drawing program It is a little bit buggy on the Tegra note 7 and appears to be sharing memory with other art apps.

Dislike latest version Overall I love this app.. wish there was a mail reader this powerful for my iPad. But this latest version broke it  at least for me. I think there might be settings  but i can't find anything. Previous version  all starred emails stayed on top. Now  not only is that no longer  but even read emails go to bottom.

POC Good concept  doesn't do 80% of what I want. Not very configurable. Generic design. No tab  skip or mute button.

This is a good communicating app in that regard however it annoyingly lets the unknown groups add you to their list and this takes over whatever you are doing at that moment. So sometimes you completely lose what you typed in other apps or all you edited in photo editors when the adding group attacks in telegram.

Der Preis ist auch nicht das Problem. Ne freiwillige Spende ohne Dreckswerbung in der App w√§re schlauer gewesen. Btw. mit Kritik kann der Herr Entwickler auch nicht umgehen...

Emulator is abandoned It's a shame really.. Would be cool if it had support for downloaded vmu files as of now a downloaded vmu file does not work. Would be awesome to be able to play psov2 online but no online support. A lot of games arnt full speed If I turn off sound the game goes at 1000x the speed. the games that came out the past few years don't work. My phone is 1000x better than dreamcast hardware yet it struggles and isnt 100 percent speed. No updates for many years why can't someone else work on it?,0,0,0,1,3592
Puzzled There is so much to like about this app. It is with real regret that I am probably going to uninstall it because I can't get it to work for me. I am using it on Android 6 with eight accounts using pop3. The problem is that mail is downloaded on some accounts only to disappear  never to be seen again. I have googled this (and the problem is widespread) but no answers that work. I am prepared to believe that it is a configuration issue but I am obviously too thick to work it out. And there is no manual.,0,1,0,1,278354
Not great from the start... (Is there any audio on this or is it just me?) This roguelike has the best AI that I have seen so far for roguelikes on Android  but that's as good as it gets... The character sprites are horrible (I even saw two characters who had GBA Fire Emblem sprites  which makes me think that this game is as original as Flappy Bird)  there isn't any audio at all  no BGM or SFX  and it has an overall bad start (I only played for a few minutes.) There are definitely better roguelikes out there.,0,0,1,1,3382
Hey  Shortyz  I have a request. When I open the app  it defaults to the top of the list of puzzles. I'm solving puzzles from a month ago  so I have to scroll through a hundred puzzles to get to where I want. How about defaulting instead to the bottom of the list of available puzzles  or at least the latest one I was working on? It's the same when I clear finished puzzles - it defaults to the top of the list - the latest puzzles  instead of where I am working. This would make the app pert near perfect. Thanks.,1,0,0,0,119990

Best CAS for Android! Started using this after Octave port became nagware. It takes a while to get used to but is breeze once you get to know the commands and syntax. The manual is very helpful and have quite a few examples for almost all the commands. Since the outputs are rendered using MathJax  you can export the output to LaTeX. This makes it great companion for compiling TeX documents on the go. Kudos to the developer for bringing Maxima to Android and keeping the spirit of open source! Much appreciated.,0,0,1,1,32681
One of the few apps I have that WORKS! At least it solved my problem which I'm not sure is what it's main function is supposed to be. But for some reason about a week ago  unnoticed by me  my phone's Wi-Fi started turning itself off. I only became aware of this when I got hit with a much higher than normal bill. I'd rooted my phone while back but wasn't able to find the cause of the problem. W/o expecting much  I tried 3 Wi-Fi apps. First 2 did nothing. This one TOTALLY solved the problem!

Probably my favorite pathfinder reference source  finally recently updated. Since the recent and long awaited update to include unchained and occult hardcover information  and even with what little bugs there are  this app is absolutely my favorite pathfinder related app. Even with all softcover content understandably missing  I still use this to reference material far more often than bothering with the pfsrd for the stuff that it does have.

Best music downloader It took me FOREVER and a day to finally find a music downloader like I used when I was a teenager 20 years ago. Frostwire is great  easy to use and fast. When my kids and I are being picky and don't want to listen to the radio or Pandora or our own music library  or there's a new song we HAVE to hear again and again  we can just pop on Frostwire and download to listen right then and also later  which is important because we can't just hop on YouTube every waking minute  nor do I want to.,0,0,0,1,124703
Multiple uses I've had this app for over a yeah & it's helped me in many different ways. I use it to focus on work that I'm not exactly thrilled to do with the studying feature. I use the sleep induction and sometimes the lucid dream when I want to be aware in my dreams.

Amazing piece of software Have used this on various old phones with varying degrees of success. Generally  the configuration on one phone will not work as well with a different one so a bit of testing is required with each model of phone used. Overall  the features available are incredible for a free app  would gladly pay for it. Users giving one star feedback and calling the app junk have to realise it is not designed for users who do not want to experiment with the settings. It's free! Give the guy a break.,1,0,1,0,8589
Update broke it Sorry  but version 1.9 was excellent. Update to 2.0 and 2.1 broke it since now sometimes the alarm is muted. Not good for something that is supposed to wake you up. The alarm volume seems to be tied media volume and not alarms. Since most of the time my media volume is very low and at night I use do not disturb  the alarm does not sound. This seems like it should not be very difficult to fix. I will reinstall when this is fixed. I also don't prefer the long press to edit  it was better before.,1,0,0,1,92291
Good start. Improvements primary necessity not aesthetics. Great looking app. A little too good for its own good perhaps. 1. Struggles with animations( option to turn them off available but still no one likes to turn animation off that too when it looks so beautiful). 2. Lacks equiliser  but still a problem that can be overcome easily. 3. Couldn't find a widget which was surprising. There's a lot of scope for this app to be a great hit!

A must play for anyone who loves RPG games but have patience! You won't even beat the first boss without dying 20+ times first  its just the nature of the game.

Amazing and addicting! I love the game despite my lack of experience with roguelikes. Still haven't beaten it yet but I play it constantly. One thing I might recommend though is rebalancing he hunger and food  either make satiety points decrease slower  increase the potency of food and the satiety point cap  or increase the frequency of food drops. Starvation has been the thing that killed me the most  and I'm very sparing with any food I get only eating when starving. Would be 5 stars if not for the hunger!,0,0,1,1,41717

I gotta say  lately all Google's targeted ads have been right on the money. Though perhaps it's because now porn and Russian bride ads are all I ever see. Even webpages that used to be fine have started redirecting me to even more graphic porn. Haven't even tried looking at any stars yet because of this new feature in Sky Maps. I hope to see this new feature in future Google apps!,1,0,1,0,167114
"Good. Need to fix some problem. Help!!! 1. Newly added collections are added directly into """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""default"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" deck.

USED TO BE GOOD - PLEASE FIX! I used to love this app! It's stability was amazing. Even the the phone hard rebooted the alarm would come right back. Now with the latest version  this thing consumes a MASSIVE amount of CPU and battery even when no alarms are set. So much so that I had to uninstall it - my phone went from fast to being unusable it was so bogged down. When browsing around with this app supposedly closed and no alarms set  it used more CPU & battery than just about all other processes combined.,0,0,0,1,92331
Please fix this problem: Like desktop version  i want to scrol to anywhere in a group or in a chat  forward a message or some messages to somebody and when i come back to the original group page or chat page  I DO NOT WANT TO BE JUMPED TO THE END OF THE PAGE.

USO 4 LIFE This app is embedded into the custom ROM that I'm running on my sprint Samsung galaxy tab 3.

Impossible Yah it's nice to throw away your time but this game is literally impossible. I can't even beat the first boss. I played the easier variant  soft pixel  and literally I can't play a character because it took all my potion to kill the second boss. If you never get strength potions it's like trying fight an entire armed force with a knife and a T-shirt. You're gonna lose  over and over and over again.

Does exactly what I wanted! Have stacks of 2nd hand books  and needed a catalogue to stop buying duplicates. The look-up series/author is also great for filling series gaps you've only found through the catalogue. Have recently found that using Google Googles as the barcode scanner no longer seems to work  perhaps due to recent move to Android 7-1-1?

Best in class! I've been using this app from the start and it's gotten better and better with every update!

Poor Grid Controls Except for the two right-most and bottom-most words  Skip Filled Boxes toggles movement to the end of the word even if previous boxes are empty along the right and bottom edges.

I have used this app for years but as I read I'm not the only one having problems. When I download a song it will download maybe 50% & when I play the song it's n slow motion. I've tried 2 different songs. Both have not been full song & have both been in slow motion. I downloaded 3 songs all together. The 1st song did fine until I tried setting it as a notification & it wouldn't let me but instead it automatically became a default ringtone when someone called. I can't believe how it's working.

Useful However  it still needs some basic features  such as: (1) a filter or separate list to show only the starred (favourite) entries  and (2) a way to change their sort order e.g. Alphabetical or reverse chronological  plus (3) one button exporting ALL captured entries to a text file (currently you have to select them one by one or set a time period).

Fantastic for book worms I purchased a different book cataloging app prior to trying this one and I wish I had saved my money! This app has recognized all but one of my books so far and I haven't run into any glitches.

So-so Bookmarks can't be edited now? Color of switches in settings should follow accent. Icon color should follow theme  not independent. Loose the lense in the app icon  it's ugly.

I got this to play pokemon and everything manages to works almost perfectly. The only issue I have is that occasionally the game will crash when you reach 100%(like when you're entering a new location and loading) but luckily the emulator has an auto save feature  and also just make sure you save before entering a new area in case the emulator crashes. It took a few minutes to figure out the saving features  make sure you go to loaded games and avoid using quick save as well since it's a bit more reliable.,1,1,0,1,118473

No permissions!!! This is a sweet app  I don't need it but found it useful when setting up digital scale level or hanging the occasional picture. Just keep in mind when calibrating that most smartphones aren't made with flat edges and make proper adjustments. In example; case-back of Galaxy S has a ~wave~  device therefore cannot sit flush.

Needs more I had this awhile back  uninstalled it because it didn't offer the same things as Facebook. I can't go to my phone gallery and choose this to send pictures to. Why not?

Easy to report faults  pants trying to view others If you want to report a fault quickly  great. Log in  locate yourself  report. Job done. However  try to view other faults locally and it all falls apart. On opening the app you can view the map  select a fault and view it. There it ends. You can't go back to the map and select another. The map view doesn't appear in the menu. The back button doesn't work. Oh  and you can't exit - you have to minims then kill in your app manager. Shame. So much potential.,0,0,0,1,72542
Made my computer crash It made Kodi crash which was fine. My computer went back to the home screen then my computer randomly shut off. I couldn't boot back in to my computer  which I've had this issue before. Luckily this time I was able to boot in to verbose mode and easily fix it even though it was a pain.

Very nice overall Does exactly what it says on the tin: Shows an agenda view of the days ahead. For my personal tastes  two additions would make this perfect: 1. The option to draw attention to today's events somehow  maybe through highlighting them with a different colour than future events or marking them with a star or something. It's easy to overlook today's events sometimes  even though they're smack dab in front of you. 2. The option to personalize the background of the widget with a personal photo.,0,0,1,1,32507

New phone  bad glitches I switched from an HTC to a Samsung S6 and now my favorite app is so buggy I can't use it. Sometimes it will work fine  but inevitably it will stop registering my taps to change location. The app isn't frozen  because I can use arrows to move  but that's cumbersome and annoying.

Absolutely fantastic I have been knitting for forty years using pen and paper to keep track of rows. I have tried a few row counters that sent me back to pen and paper  then I found Bee Count.

You can make notes and set alarms when the row count target is reached. You can program multiple projects and importantly when you close the app it automatically saves your progress.,0,0,0,0,43807
The widget is minimalistic and tap to refresh is excellent (especially the visual indicator with the 3 dots)! What would make the widget perfect though is to have a 1x1 size widget  especially because it seems that the existing price indicator can fit just fine in the 1x1 space (without icon or decimals)  so it seems reasonable and I can't really afford for the widget to take space for 2 icons. I actually recommend 1x1 to be the only one because from there everybody can resize to their liking (to bigger).,0,0,0,1,69497

Reporting a bug fix Thanks for this awesome app. However at first when I installed it and enabled it  it dint work out (though I got a notification saying that night mode toggle has been inserted in my notification bar).

Generally Good By far much better than the highly advertised NPR One app. Easy to access shows like morning addition  hourly updates  and all things considered.

Great Again! I was a loyal user for years. I loved the simplicity of the UI and customization options for each alarm you set up. I had to delete this app when my Samsung S5 updated to Android 6.0 because the snooze function stopped working.

This app is excellent for quick access to real-time BART departures.

Works even better in Android 6.0 With Android 6.0  the VPN settings interface now shows OpenConnect as an option.

Almost perfect If it only had the ability to go back  like 10-15 seconds  so if you missed something  you could hear it again...The only way with this app  is to drag the timeline progress bar  and that isn't as convenient or precise as the short review arrow provided by Smart AudioBook Player.

"Really liking it Updated review after using for several weeks. This app is great. I especially like the widgets that are easy to check off.

Rapid sync  no clutter  privacy Thanks to the developers for this wonderful application which replaces my android stock app. I almost gave up on finding a mail app which doesn't ask for a ton of permissions until I found K9. A few minor suggestions for improvements: It should be possible to move mails to folders of different accounts  and generally the moving of mails could still be simplified. Another desirable feature would be a rapid delete gesture and an undo button for the last move/delete action.,1,0,0,0,278432
What Happened?! For simplicity and ease of use  this was 1 of 2 go-to browsers  and 1 of 2 that I gladly gave 5 stars and a few bucks in support of the dev.

At first I blamed the messed up SM-G900V MM update  which has more bugs than a Minnesota summer. However  reading forums and feedback here  I am now sure the new ver. is to blame.

Better than Good Budget Cash is the way to go for budgeting and I tried Good Budget for several months and it's just over kill. This is simple and easy. Add the money  take it out or transfer it.

Love this reader. Tons of customization  decent text rendering and the support of Mobi-book format. The only thing negative I see so far is the slow opening  especially by ePubs: sometimes it took 10-20 secs just to open a book! If you can fix this  it would be perfect! The default view of the library is also confusing and not helpful. Better change the default view to show all books in bigger cover thumbnail.

Good basic.. This alarm clock is very dependable. There's no way to delete a bunch of the old alarms without doing it one by one.

Amazing utility This is not for people who do not understand Lennox or how to root a phone if you are a power user and want to optimize your system the best of it's possible capabilities and this is perfect for you you have the ability to export logs to monitor logs I played with it for about 10 minutes and I've learned a lot more about my phone it natively abstracts so much more information from an unrooted phone such as my current one which happens to be Droid Turbo 2 which has yet to be unlocked.,0,0,0,0,65760
Needs more automation. This add-on fails for people with dynamic computer addresses. I have a mix of Windows and Samba shares and they all have a dynamic address. This means that I have to check the address every time or set every device to a fixed IP  UGH. I prefer the ability to browse the SMB shares without all of the typing. See the ASUS file manager which provides easy machine and share browsing. However  I still like and use the Ghost file manager. I just leave the SMB portion to another tool.,0,1,0,1,60287
Used to love it I am not sure what happened. On Thursday  this app was amazing. I used it to do work when I was on the road  updating different things on the dashboard from my app. No joke  I loved this app. I manage 5 sites through it.

Ok but could be better 4/06/2012 - A little outdated in how it looks  could be better in describing how to setup ie actually give the option for push or manual sync. Add a schedule for when mail is synced and then give option to just manual sync etc outside of those times. These are only things tying me to stock! 23/4/2016 - same applies....only this time gmail fails to configure as the app doesn't comply with modern security standards...oh well..2nd attempt in 4 years ends in disappointment again..,1,1,0,0,278435
Not perfect  but close The app works  but it's a little buggy  there are random delays and freezes  but it mostly works. I feel as if those are issues that can be fixed with an update  which is why I took away one star. The other star is because there isn't an option to use my phone as a passthrough evice for audio (very similar to how the Roku remote operates)  if I could plug headphones into my phone which would mute my Kodi device  that would give this app it's 5th star  still a solid 3 star app.,1,1,1,0,49771

Too difficult Failed at installing locally due to Google changes to Android 4.4+ something something about binary.

Perfect app  prefer the old icon As the title says  the app works perfectly and I love the quick reply feature. This app fits in well with stock android M apps with material design and such.

I didn't download tor  but came here to be smart and warn people about why tor isn't a good place. I read that tor is being used to find and host pedophile websites.

Five stars So far great app. Fast  light  just what you need. My first time giving a 5 star to an sms app. I might add to have a new option when creating a new message to show recent contacts in the call logs.

Extremely useful  but... The app is just amazing generally  it just has a couple of quirks that happen sometimes that don't exactly ruin its functionality  but they are slightly annoying. For example  when the screen goes to sleep and I turn it on again  or if I exit the app and open it again  it will have reset to the first playlist instead of the one I'm on. It generally does that  like when browsing the library  entering a folder and then going back it starts at the top again. Otherwise perfect.,0,0,1,1,67089

Fantastic Game Have played this game since the original and love the changes you guys have made  especially here recently. My only frustration with the game is getting a weapon with an enchantment only to see the enchantment disappear after a few upgrades.

Maybe make enchanted weapons rarer to find but make the enchaments permanent to the weapon? Just a suggestion...keep up the good work!,0,0,0,1,172602
Other's concerns were unfounded Two concerns from others turned out to be non-issues for me. 1. You do not need to install a 3rd-party barcode reader to make this app work because there is an option to confirm your device by just manually typing a code. 2. After installing this app  there are still other ways to get into your account if you lose your phone.

Best Android Game This is the most addictive game I've ever played on my phone. I really hope they go on to update it further  partially because I'm practically out of things to do besides grind to level up more  and also because the main quest is incredibly well done so far. It may not be the flashiest game  but it doesn't need to be flashy - the gameplay is solid and complex  easy to learn and hard to master.

Very nice camera app  but: Issues: 1. Isn't there a Pause button? 2. Volume keys doesn't change exposure when set to do so. 3. Exposure options are reset every time video/photo mode is toggled and when app restart; this is very boring. 4. Screen rotation should rotate notification bar too; looks like app doesn't truly rotate screen and always start in landscape. 5. Why not merge video and photo modes?

Thank you for such a terrific free app. The latest version has lots of cool features. May I suggest some features/fixes? A setting to allow attachment list to appear on top or below message body.

A one-eyed king in the land of the blind is what this app is. Offers limited sources of puzzles (not its fault)  most of which are boring.

Shines a light... ... To where your problems may be. As a previous reviewer said  the app is not a panacea that will solve all your issues  but it will absolutely give you a detailed look into what may be causing unexpected battery drain. Yes  there is some searching involved  along with trial and error to actually nail down a cause  but that's not the fault of the app. This app shoves you in the right direction. It's more than useful in fixing a difficult  multi-pronged annoyance (battery drain).,0,1,0,0,26555
Completely Broken This app used to work now the calibration is way off shows the horizon from bottom left corner to top right corner. Shows the moon to the North  have calibrated  reset  uninstalled and reinstalled all with the same bad results. Basically this app is useless as it is nothing on the screen is where it is in the sky. Do not bother with this as there are many more that do work. Even after turning off the gyro things are still wrong the Map shows the moon almost straight up it is 8pm.,0,0,1,1,167718
A really good RPG. I can't wait to see how it progresses. There's a lot of side quests  and the gameplay is really nice. You have to grind quite a bit  but it feels rewarding when you level up. The game is quite challenging. The main storyline isn't completed  there is no soundtrack (though that doesn't bother me)  and the assets need improvement (I saw the thief sprite and many others from Fire Emblem!). Maybe some more maps and locations  quests  and game lore. I'll try to help by making quests!,0,0,0,1,3506
Be careful  this app used to clear clipboard when the app closes  it no longer does. So when you use it to copy and paste a password  it stays in your clipboard. Why should you care? Well  try pasting in any app hours after you close keepass and you will still see your password. Since clipboard is not secure  other apps on your phone can now see your password. I checed their help log and someone brought this up over 4 months ago and the problem persists. For a security app  this is very dangerous.,1,1,0,0,116330
Deleted after first day I researched apps and this one was highly recommended  I noticed more recent views were negative but decided to try it anyway. The app only got through a couple thousand texts and then gave me an error and timed out  it was also extremely slow backing up the texts it did get through. I looked at the texts that backuped and contacts were switched because they were texts from contacts I have never texted with including landlines. Deleted and used SMS Backup & Restore instead.,0,1,0,0,23034
Keeps Crashing. Very glitchy. Lost all data Was in the middle of playing Pok?mon White when the game crashed when a pokemon FINALLY gained EXP points! When I came back to this app  only option I could do was start a new game! What! All my game data had been erased even though it kept slowing the game down with its stupid auto save every now and then! Wtf! I don't want to start all over again. Please get rid of the auto save! It doesn't do anything except slow the game down! Otherwise  not bad app.,1,1,1,1,117396
Great! Best chess program I have probably used. Tried using it against Ubisoft's Chessmaster on a AMD A8-6600K (Quad-Core 3.9GHz) with 8GB RAM and It won everytime. It even won all online games that I've tried. I still havent tried it against stockfish on PC tough. The apps analysis mode is great  though I don't like playing againt it.

What happened? There is a serious problem with Android release 4.3 of Subsonic.  I upgraded to this version last night  and overnight accumulated over 10GB worth of data charges (yes- 10GB).  This is way more than I typically use in 3 months  and I am being charged &gt; $100 USD for this overage.  My player was not being used at all at this time  and I had it next to my bed charging.

Simply entertainment Wonderful game. I am interrupted in 5 minute increments daily. I can play this in my down time  yet drop it instantly and come back to it.

Google = big brother This app takes total control of your phone. It can (& does) take pictures & record voice  and even send that info out  all without your knowledge.

Used to be 5 star For the past 4 months  some of the puzzles download the exact same puzzle as prior times. The New York Times Classic is the biggest offender. I have not had a new puzzle in months. Always the same one. Also the puzzle clues ad anvancing (as you finish one clue  autojumping to the next) can't wrap around the puzzle.

Great but with bugs Works as advertised  mostly. One issue I've noticed is that the full brightness setting doesn't keep the screen at full brightness  as the screen *immediately* dims back to my system setting  essentially making the full brightness setting not work at all. Also whenever Google Now updates a card (say a sporting event score) in my system notification area the app turns the screen on  so my screen turns on every 5 minutes or so. Thankfully the app allows you to exclude some apps.,0,1,0,1,102267
This app has a lot of praise  and I agree. It quickly replaced my last oldschool habit tracker. I love it. Two things would make it perfect to me: 1. Make another single-cell widget that shows your current streak number. It is really motivating when your number gets up high. It helps you to make the right decision when you think about resetting to 0. The number could replace the checkmark. 2. Have a backup system  probably through Google. It would complete the system. Thanks so much for this app.,1,0,0,1,284557

Works  but lacks some functionality Interface is clean and uncluttered  quite intuituve. However  1: no apparent support for multiple media centers if not configured immediately - app will keep searching for initial configuration and requires a data clear to add another media center  2: unlike XBMC remote  filenames truncated even on landscape view so difficult to choose episodes or movies with long names. Fix these minor issues  five stars. And thanks to the XBMC/Kodi team for all the good work.,0,1,1,1,49473
Rpg maker Graphics were basic and  although I usually love people who use rpg maker to make their games  this one seemed clunky. That's the downside: the up side is that it DOES have a good quest system and a decent battle system to boot. The movement controls however need some tweeking. Sorry man  I hate giving a crappy review but I love giving an honest opinion so you can make it the best you can. I will definitely be checking back after a few updates though  this game has potential to be good!,0,0,0,1,2978

Excellent Excellent application but there are two things I'd like to mention. Firstly  the listen command isn't working. The application crashes every time I enter the command.

Love it Works flawlessly with DotT and Sam&Max. The Legend of Kyrandia will crash the game when you try to heal the bird. Closing the app completely and rebooting your tablet has no effect. Bit depressing if you're forgetful like me and forget to save frequently. But seeing as this is the first time I've seen the app crash in the 10 months I've used it  I'll give you 4/5 (will there be a fix to Beneath a Steel Sky ? can't go past linc  where you have to blind the eye and pick up the tuning fork.),0,1,0,1,174319
The app works very well. But in the end I've decided it doesn't match my workflow well. I've used for a long time a simple text file to manage tasks  similar to markdown; the advantage is that I can create (long) notes in the same place  that I can create subtasks with arbitrary levels and that I can move tasks around between multiple sections: tasks to do today  tasks to do soon  long term tasks and completed tasks. I can also render that in a smaller font with compact lines to see more content.,0,0,0,0,98418
The ONLY way I could get this to work on my Nvidia Shield Portable was to put the bios files in /storage/emulated/0/data folder  then select /storage/emulated/0 as the system path in the app settings.

Small footprint  really customizable [3-star edit: The backup functionality does NOT backup the appearance settings  a pitty. ] You can modify the style to anything you like  but it takes some playing around the settings to get something nice.

Much better I used to get very frustrated as cycle streets wouldn't re-route. I used it today and it was loads better : re-routing just like it should.

Changed it It was an amazing app. If I remember correctly the outlines of the astrological signs connecting stars were beautifully outlined and displayed clearly when you passed your phone throughout the Sky.that was removed. Not only that. You were able to follow any stars trajectory time East to west when you tapped on an object. it placed a circle as a tracking orbit around the planet. It's been also removed. That was the best feature. Unless I deactivated by accident which I don't think so.,1,0,1,0,166078
Still not stable I've tried like hell to use this for years  and it still causes apps to not open. After boot  before boot etc. Very rarely has it worked flawlessly.

Breaks sound locker First of all  the majority of people with android don't even use this. It might be useful if you are busy looking at something else but most people don't and we can't even uninstall it. I have a nexus 5X and since the update every time I restart my phone it says TalkBack has stopped. If I go back then I can no longer change my sound volume.

Improvements needed 1. It needs to recognise when something else is talking! If the Google App is reading out a search result  TalkBack should not read out the same text simultaneously but at a slightly different speed! It should talk only when it has exclusive use of the audio. 2. Whose bright idea was it to change the default gestures? Unless you know the new gestures  you can't navigate to the setting to restore your old preferences! Needs a pop screen asking if you want new defaults or not.,1,0,0,0,75954

Not as good as WLD This app is good (4 stars)  but it is not as good as Wakelock Detector. Make sure you check out both before you PAY for this. I personally prefer WLD.

Nice for hidding files or prevent their thievery. This app supports images  videos and any file you want to hide! it also decrypts on the go if you just want to see your files just from the app. Easy to use and nice interface. The only problem i have is that the in-app gallery doesn't correct my photos orientation when showing them  and i can't rotate and save them in there  you should implement the same functionallity that galeries in Android use to auto correct orientation. 4* cause of that.,1,1,0,1,16335
A lot of bugs. Good but not complete If your looking for a lockscreen this app is incomplete. In fact  it notes the lockscreen feature is still in beta testing so really this app is not doing its 1 job. Example: phone unlocks automatically without swiping and can be done by just a button. Sometimes even auto unlocks when a notification comes up. For the most part this app looks promising as it's clean and minimal. However it's like a video-game you buy which needs constant DLC to make it work.,1,1,0,1,27267
Seems a bit unintuitive to set the shutter speed or control the exposure. You have to set a manual override for ISO  and then you gain access to on-screen controls to set ISO and shutter speed. It would be helpful to (a) allow a manual +/- adjustment to automatic exposure  and (b) allow setting shutter speed vs ISO under the automatic exposure mode. It would also be nice to have a histogram and focus peaking - even if they're only updated every half a second or so. Otherwise it all seems good.,0,0,0,1,169728

Great for crosswords I've had this app for a few years now  and I've always really liked it  especially because you can get lots of puzzles without being nagged to subscribe to keep using them.

So sometimes it just keeps zooming out further and further  when I just want to switch clues. Other than that  no complaints about this app.,1,0,0,1,119938
Great app. This app has proven invaluable for keeping me under my data cap. The Android OS ability to pause data usage after a user defined limit is great  but there are some things you just can't afford to pause. For example I wanted to pause everything EXCEPT messaging & phone/VoIP apps  but using the OS controls it's all or nothing.

It's no full fledged epub reader  and even failed to load one for me. I wouldn't go without it  though  and it is my go-to viewer for PDFs  for its awesome responsiveness.,1,1,0,0,67217

Of late I've noticed the size of the Google Play Services binary has decreased in size slightly at least in variants 030 and 032. Its still pretty big but this is an improvement. Devices with smaller memories are still having difficulty using it but is not worsening. Google Play Services is needed to run GAPPS and a good many other apps.

Used to be my go to music downloading app. Especially with the feature to download full albums  but for the past few months (it seemed to be from the update where it pops up the window to select what songs from the album you want to download) nothing has downloaded to my phone. Very disappointing and none of the updates have done anything about it. Hopefully that gets fixed. Update Nov 2016. Still just absolute garbage. Nothing I try to download will.

Great features  but some bugs. I love how you can queue up podcasts  and when one ends it starts with the next one. The fatal flaw is that if I have an hour long podcast playing  it often cuts off at 30mins and starts with the next one. Also I can't seem to reorder podcasts in the queue  even though it is supposed to be a feature. It also seems impossible to load more shows  selecting the feature just duplicates the existing list of shows. If these were worked out it would be a perfect app.,1,1,1,1,162754
Great App But With Some Problems I enjoyed playing many adventure games using this app. It feels great! However  this app has some problems. Beneath A Steel Sky's mouse pointer is black instead of white and the menu (which it has a speed adjustment which requires to get a certain item in LINC) doesn't show up when I hit the back button. Then  Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror's cutscenes are often choppy. EDIT: I downloaded BS2's DXA's cutscenes on ScummVM's website and they run smoothly.,0,1,0,1,174124

Permissions I think these permissions should be optional because for example  if I play some game or watch youtube videos and I don't want to tell my exact location to these services. For example if I want to use Gmail as my email I don't want to give permission for microphone because Gmail doesn't need to listen to me (there is no function for recording audio to email so this permission is for survaillance).

Incredible Already brilliant  but the new feature-rich update made it incredible. However just one concern that droidfish can drain all my battery in less than 40 minutes when in analysis mode.(Pondering mode switched off). It seems to drain battery even when I have exited it. I understand it's quite an unreasonable demand  but if the developers can find a way to make it drain less battery while still provide excellent quality of analysis  then droidfish would be extraordinarily-incredible!,1,0,0,1,100916
Gives peace of mind Great app  thank you very much! Auto-archives all your text msgs & call logs into your Gmail acct. Texts lumped together so need to search by person  words  or dates  unless want to browse thru long groups of conversations w each person.

You can also open the app and manually back up msgs you wanna delete right away.,0,0,0,1,21153
Good  with one issue This extension works beautifully  except in one case. Multiple notifications (non-stacked) from one application seem to break its counter. Case in point  I have two Gmail accounts set up on my phone. When either one gets an email while the other account doesn't  everything works fine. If both accounts get an email and show a notification  however  then the widget starts acting oddly. Anyone know of a fix for this?

Hi..... I want to suggest something.... That is when we delete a message log from gmail why it can't make the backup again??? For example I deleted the message log of my friend because his log consists 100 messages but I want only 50 to 60 that were important.... I restored messages  I also deleted that messages from gmail account in sms able and the I deleted 40 messages of my friend when I tried to backup those 60 messages the app can't make backup of them It shows nothing to back up.....,0,0,0,0,23307
Works flawlessly  no crashing at all if you have a modern phone since android 4 is not a supported platform anymore. Works without issues from lollipop to android N. No issues at all unless you side load the wrong play services apk from the internet. Since all phones bought out now are lollipop or upwards you shouldn't have any issues unless your phone is over 2 or so years old then you will most likely have issues as your using an old android which product support has officially ended for.,1,1,0,1,234401
Very nice gallery  100% clean permissions  open-source and constantly updated and answered. // Suggestion: It would be very useful to have a mini horizontal gallery at bottom like in the Gallery app from Samsung. 2.2.1: still has some problem with files and folders; eg. one folder is displayed twice  one with the files whose names start with # and the other with the rest of the files.

Terrible image management This app is flat awful and unusable for a blog with images. First you have to insert a photo into a post to get it into your media library. Then you have to select the same photo to be the featured image. BUT then the post will show the SAME photo twice!

I've been looking for a decent gallery app for my HTC 10 ever since HTC started forcing users over to the Google photos app.. side loading the old gallery was an option but the only control on the SD card was as a viewer so you could not copy/past to the SD card or edit photos once they were saved there. It was a massive pain in the backside. This is a simple app with few permissions needed. There is some basic customisation too for the UI which is a nice touch.. and most importantly no ads,1,0,1,0,65010
If it ain't broke... Like many have noted  the latest update appears broken. Main issues  for me  are account sizes now showing arbitrary large values even when completely empty & that the app now appears randomly laggy.

Really liked this app  so please roll back & fix issues in meantime. Looking forward to giving its 5 stars back.,1,1,1,1,279048
Wonderful! A thorough work has been done here - content-wise and design-wise. Thank you.

Nice emulator but... I can't change the screen orientation so I can use my VOLUME UP button as my right trigger. That's really the only issue I'm having.

Best SS android client. Used for months. Flawless and continuous improving updates. The only problem I found was for some reason it defaults to using the external sd card storage to download music files to. This results in very large mp3 files to stutter. This is probably not a problem for most. Since my collection is primarily Grateful Dead  some songs are very long. So if you have similar problems  create folder on your device storage  then change the settings in the app. You'll be fine.,0,1,1,0,173474

Good app Naturally  if its bouncing your traffic off three different nodes and encrypting your traffic three times and then decrypting traffic three times  it is going to be slower than normal browsing.

A Good Game  But Too Hard I liked the game at first  but I wish there were some difficulty controls. I consistently die on levels 1  2  or three. Wraith and piranha are too strong  food is scarce and starvation kills quickly  and so forth.

Great app  feature heavy Unlike other similar apps  this focuses on being more 'open'; you're not tied to any services or accounts  instead logging is local and you have a range of options of where to upload and in what format to record data. Dropbox support is a massive plus. GPS naturally uses a lot of power  so I suggest sticking with cell towers if you're in a city  as the precision should be sufficient for most scenarios. Great app overall  aimed at a more technical use case scenario.,1,0,0,1,285379
Runs well even on less powerful devices. The app is no longer updated on the play store as far as I can tell  more recent versions can be found on their website.

Really Nice Software Overall I have to give this Chess GUI an 'A'. You can see a lot of thought and hard work has gone into this program.

Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 I've been using this app more or less since android phones 1st came out & it has been a big help in helping me set tones on my phone the way I want it. But the last update has made the app faulty.

But the major change has to be do is that the floating shortcut doesn't appeare as soon as text is been coppied on clipboard and the thing which has to be done is firstly we have to pull down the notification tray and then after putting it back the floating shortcut appeares and also the bubble short cut is insecure while using banking apps so I would rate app as 5 star only when you people will develop an app of such a form that app will not ask acesseblity permission.,0,0,1,1,99896
In general aplicatia e de ajutor. Mai greseste orele autobuzelor Expres sau intoarcerile la capat de linie  dar e ok.

There are some several issues  which made me rate this a 4/5 instead of a 5/5. Firstly  there is an issue with the audio in some games  which bugs me a lot! A bit laggy and distorted.

I tested this app by comparing the quality of a range of images taken by this app  other top (free & paid) camera apps on the Play Store  and the default Android camera app; and the conclusion is that this app generates the highest quality photos  with the slight tradeoff of slow capture time. In my opinion  that is a worthy tradeoff. To the developer(s): If the capture speed could be improved this app would truly be perfect! Thank you for this amazing app  and keep up the great work!,1,0,1,1,171617
Invaluable language learning resources. Only thing that would make this better is if the automatic TTS option allowed for specifying what you want it to read. It basically wrecks cards in languages like Japanese because it reads Kanji out to you before you can confirm you know the reading  but i would still very much like to hear only the question side of the card once I've revealed the answer side (answers on the other hand  i don't need read  and it just reads everything right now),0,0,0,1,97795
Very good overall Ability to look up Wikipedia even without Internet connection (and connection costs .. and delays) is often invaluable. The application is very good overall  although there is still some room for improvement: Search function is a bit strict regarding to case and diacritics: You get much more warships with 'HMS ..' and 'USS ..' than with 'hms ..' and 'uss ..'  and if you are not used to diacritics you can look up Rohanese 'Lord of the Rings' heroes only indirectly ..,0,0,0,1,131531
Great compatibility with natural controls I've played Loom  Full Throttle  and the first two Monkey Island games with this. Perfect each and every time as far as I could tell.

The thirty second black screen is annoying but it consistently loads. In a way it simulates waiting for the computer to boot.,1,0,0,1,174357

Reicast: Now the only worthwhile Dreamcast Emulator. Period. Even as a successor to NullDC  it is FAR more easy to use than that product wished it could be. And even for an Android based program  it's one of the best of it's kind. And even for a supposed ALPHA  it's fantastic at what it does and only has a few losses in game compatibility that  especially this early in development  are sure to be resolved soon. Anyone with even a passing interest in Dreamcast games  this is a must.,1,0,0,1,4942

Great wallpapers! Just one little suggestion tho  if you guys could just allow us  the users  to allow the wallpaper to not be translucent after we double tap it. Right now  it's translucent  (after double tap) transparent  (after a few seconds or so) translucent again. Now I would like it if you guys would have the wallpaper to remain transparent until we double tap it to be translucent again. Get it?

Such an amazing app. When searching the internet for books please make an option for multiple books to show up instead of just one. Had to type every word on the front cover for each one then had to switch the words around on several. I love this app though. Thank you for making it.,0,1,0,1,158724
Good  but I have recently discovered that the 'Best Steak' is misleading  since the App adds days shown in a transparent way in the 'History' section (why?) which alters the 'Best Streak' section. So  instead of i.e. 2 days that have actually been accomplished it shows  say  12. I didn't have this before  it only appeared recently. What I mean can be seen in your 4th. screenshot above. Quite annoying. If this wont be fixed I will be uninstalling. Other than that  very good app.,0,0,0,1,284554

Get Adaway instead if rooted. Otherwise get NoRoot Data Firewall (it has domain filtering and no ads  also works much more stable and has a nicer color theme).

Easy to use I like this app. I used it before & just recently reinstalled it. My only issue with it is that only incoming text messages are backed up & not outgoing ones. I'm not sure why. If there's a solution to this I'd love to know what it is. As of today 4/14/16 I'm changing my rating because I never received a response to any emails I sent to Jan asking for assistance.

Great App/Responsive Developer I find this app very useful. I wanted a way to watermark my art invisibly. This is wonderful! At first  I had an issue trying to decrypt the messages.

Great game - until degredation I love the game; mechanics  graphics  and gameplay. If you think fading updates are good  please make them an option (edit: SkillFull PD did this); that has single-handedly made me go from 5 to 3 stars.

Light weight and surprisingly quick. I have loved Zlauncher when it is working  but it's buggy and heavy. This launcher  in comparison  is light and simple  and the smart autocomplete menu makes it quick to use. I was worried there'd be a bunch of non-linux junk I'd have to memorize  but no!

Buggy App Update:. The problems with the app only seem to get worse.

Perfect dimmer for dark surroundings. Use it all the time! I have it on auto dim  great feature! UPDATE 1/1/17 dropped 2 stars  new update has messed it up. It no longer stays on even though lock screen says it's on and at desired setting . When phone is unlocked  it shuts off and it has to be turned on again. Its really annoying at night.

Still needs balance. I actually like all the new things and increase for searching but way too unforgiving . Unless you get lucky on first levels with awesome weapon armor and definitely horn of plenty your dead by king or thereabouts. There is a need to level up and grind a little and search. All this just increases food consumption. Needing the horn and likely a wealth ring and absolutely needing plate and tier3 plus weapon by king is a lot of necessities for survival.,0,0,0,1,172594
The perfect camera! For several months  I have been looking for a camera app that stamped the date and/or time on pictures. Before I found this one  every other camera was filled with ads  bloatware  and premium features. Not only does this camera have an interface that's very easy to customise  the date and time can be tailored to suit your photographic needs. The best part is that there are NO ADS  NO FEES  and NO TRIALS! Thank you very much for an outstanding product!,1,0,0,1,169398
The best open-source kernel tuner Literally  the best kernel tuning app  and I want to propose you something: can you  please  add either BusyBox or custom binaries installer?

Its Achilles' heel is there is no way to sync all the information pertaining to tasks across devices or at least automatically back it up to the likes of Drive or Dropbox.

Great App  Poor Changes? I love this app  but the new version seems to have disabled double tapping to unblur the background. Is this on purpose?

Monetary motivations to monitor your messages to tailor an advertising solution to target you specifically. The ads don't bug me much.

Search icon changes position Search icon changes its position every damn time this app starts. Take a look at your picture number 4 and 3. At startup  search icon is near the upper right corner.

I used this on my Samsung S4 with ICS  and it worked good. Upgraded to Note 5 running Lolipop 5.1.1 and was woke up last night to the sound of a notification  vibration and LED from Facebook. Why? I had notifications  vibration and system sounds all set to off. Also  this app lacks the ability to disable or turn off the LED. Updated 4-30-17: this app no longer works since my Note 5 upgraded to Nougat. The developer web site no longer exists. Sad  this WAS a great app.,0,0,0,1,16283

Love it Using and dependant for long time. Never failed. Now  observed that while backing up data  it is directly showing google drive on first place. In between i hv changed handset and android version. Earlier i used to back up in sd card and then upload it to cloud. Whatever happened is good!

Very good Great app  easy to use  perfect for my xword fix. If I run out of puzzles I just load a random date from years ago... Good archive. The new design is pretty OK. Every great once in a while the app glitches and the only solution is to reinstall  which is what I'm doing right now because a lag developed and won't go away. Another glitch that happens is the puzzle zooms out to the max and won't stay fit to the screen until reinstall. Again  they're pretty rare.,0,0,0,1,120045
I love this app! I just want to say that you did a great job on this app. I use it every night to lull myself to sleep. Problem is though  it's too bright! I had to find a screen dimmer app and it's still not a good solution. The app only overlays a black image over the screen set to whatever opacity you prefer. But that makes it difficult to see mistakes. I'd love it if you could invert the colors and change the white text and blocks to grey. Thanks for reading this!,1,1,0,1,119991
Decent emulator controls suck though Im using an xperia z3 with a dualshock 4. It does detect the DS 4 but it seems to not detect the analog sticks  which is vital for movement. it doesnt even detect vibration motors inside ds4 either which isnt such a big deal.

Very close to five stars but... Nearly perfect  but when I try to play along and the music is scrolling too fast  I have to tap the screen to stop it; and that often causes a change in the speed setting  which is infuriating -- especially since it's quite hard to set an exact speed with the slider in the first place. Can we PLEASE have the music speed as a setting in the tune properties  rather than an onscreen slider -- or the option of one or the other? Many thanks.,0,0,1,1,15009
It is a simple light app that does the job. I didnt want one with the excess bloat so this is exactly what i was looking for. I sent a feedback to the developer and got a response the same morning! Wow! Only additional feature i would like to see is the ability to view pictures in a folder like a gallery (ability to swipe between photos). Currently it simply opens the one picture in the photo viewer app of your choice so it doesnt allow you to swipe to the next photo.,1,0,0,1,70756
Great This app lets me see photos sorted by when they were taken or last modified rather than having to search through folders such as various camera apps  downloads folder  screenshots  image editors and so on. * The app called Trillian  has the same feature for when you want to share an image with a friend on instant messaging or social media. This feature is a very hard one to find because many of the apps descriptions  sound like they support it  but they don't. *,1,0,0,1,64646
Connecting issues The app is perfect the only issue is when shut down the raspberry and then restart it the app just try to connect to it. The problem is that the raspberry changes its ip and the app can't find it. A solution it came to my mind is that the app don't search the raspberry with its ip but with its name. The only bad thing with this is that someone may have to raspberry with the same name but this is his problem. Sorry for my bad English. I wish I helped.,1,1,1,1,49608
No Longer a Reliable option for Text Backup I've used this app for years and it was my go?to-app for text backup. I tried to contact the developer for a few questions and received no response.

Just 1 'but' This application is so good  since I like my front screen clean.

I believe the app has great potential  however on Android M with finger sensor  the Google lockscreen often requires a pin following the finger sensor read with AcDisplay with Active Mode enabled.

Open source  light  missing easy backup After playing with it a bit the only downside is the backup. It needs a proper way to generate a local backup which I could copy to a computer with a truecrypt volume using sftp. To backup you need to use the adb command on your computer. Connect your phone and run: adb backup -f freeotp.bak org.fedorahosted.freeotp That will store the FreeOTP data to the file freeotp.bak. To restore this data  just run: adb restore freeotp.bak,1,0,1,1,132710

Concept is good.. I missed the gestures on CM7 now on CM11 but the lock screen doesn't perform as perfectly as CM7 hoped to have custom gestures. And also if I hold down my recents key it shows up n I can kill the lockscreen even if I have a pin.. Holding my back key (as I configured it to) will kill the app... The whole point of security falls there... Apart from the pin security the app is good... 5 stars if the bugs are fixed and custom gestures can be implemented,1,1,1,1,43122

Something changed This alarm used to work quite well for me but recently I overslept a few times.

Functional at Best. Use Authy app instead This app is the minimum you would expect. It's functional  but that's it. If you want cloud sync to your computer  or just a backup of your codes in case your phone is stolen  or you want to switch phones without resetting your two factor authentication codes for every account  use Authy app instead.

Great. Except no dual account sync. Open source equivalent of GTasks and Tasks Free. Both of which are good. But this is better  simpler  and open source. It also handles multiple accounts  although its UI doesn't make that clear. Just sign into the second one in settings.

Amazing I feel the best part about this game was that it is not addicting. It's fun. The two words have a difference. I actively want to play pixel dungeon.

Nice app. Easy to use and has a nice look. A couple of features that would top this app off would be the ability to have it also show all the books in a series (for example) to make it easier for people to see what books they may be missing when trying to complete a set. It would then also need to have a check box to indicate if the book is in the library or not  and having the app automatically offer to complete the series when a book is scanned in would be grand.,1,0,0,1,158557
Nothing special Everybody talks about this app  even service providers suggest to use it but it really doesn't do anything that others won't do.

Im all for a hard game and challenging dungeon crawl but this game is just ridiculous. Starving to death will be the death of this game. Even if you learn to strategize and make your way down to the ninth floor you will have no health left to face the second boss. If by some miracle you arent starved to death by then he is impossible to hit. Not to mention that he can hit you from across the room the entire fight. Death is irreversable and there is no save feature.,1,0,1,1,42906
The emulator itself is perfect  which is why it's so disappointing that the developer would sabotage it's own emulator. They decided it was a good idea to map the back button to BOTH the savestate menu as well as a savestate button. This means that when you go back to load a previous savestate  it is overwritten by the same button that lets you visit that menu. Truly a shame  hopefully a competent dev will pick up these broken pieces and make something half-decent.,1,0,0,1,52897

Something is off with this app today. Stopped working then it works and then it stops again off and on  and has not done this for ever. Using BlackPlayer EX and always has worked until today.

REQUEST to DEV I gave a 5 star review on my acoustic music profile so I'm using my alternative profile to ask you if there is any way you can implement a feature that the app NETWORK CONNECTIONS has by way of when you click on an active connection you can ALSO see if any ABUSERS are using that particular Isp.

One of the most amazing apps in all mobile ecosystems! Has a really good algorithm. Loved the black theme. Kept my AMOLED screen running for 20mins at only 2%battery.

I am not blind  but I was curious and I tried the app using the phone with the eyes closed.

Great where it counts I give this 5 stars for the sheer amount of information it provides  its simplicity  and a feature no one else has: showing Celsius and Fahrenheit together. Skin idea is good.

Excellent app but... User must switch tables or backout of the current database to force app to ask user to commit changes.

I really enjoy this game! Possible Bug Short and sweet--I like this game a lot! One issue I have had is with the Talisman of Foresight. Whenever I equip this item  the game begins to gradually lag inceasingly until it becomes quite intense. I've equipped this artifact in ~3 playthroughs and can confirm this issue every time. It's frustrating enough that I no longer equip it even when I have an open accessory slot--I just sell it! Other than that  great game Evan!,0,1,1,1,172755

Also it suffers from a few annoying usability issues  most notably the fact that for some reason  if you want to load all the stories from a program like All Things Considered into your playlist  you need to scroll down to the bottom of the list  load more  scroll  load  scroll load.

Made my battery heat  even though I didn't change any setting. I used the default setting only. Every time my battery began to heat  I've to reboot my device.

I don't need an app which is promoting bad art to me Recently I started looking through an April archive and discovered winter landscape by Liza Nurik. I was thinking how I can learn about this artist? Ordinary  an app using only masterpieces. And I learned from an app store that she is probably some relative of an app developer.

Richard Cooper I have been using this with success in the past with my Galaxy S4. I now have a Google Nexus 6 running Lollipop and can't get the phone to see the RTL dongle. The driver just says that 'no device found' I would be interested to hear if anyone else has luck with this phone. Also tried via externally powered hub and still no joy.

Fine in beginning but goes downhill after that Used to be my favorite battery monitoring app. In my last 3 phones  it worked fine upon installation  but started acting strange after that. The widget does not update the battery percentage correctly  gets stuck reflecting a high percentage even the OS battery settings show a significant drop. Also shows inaccurate time since the last charge. Was hopeful it would return to normal after an update but if never did.,1,0,1,0,165175

I like your app but there are two issues First: I use facebook messenger's chat heads  when I unlock the phone the messenger chat head bubbles spoils the clean-ish look..

Buffer & Bluetooth Issues I'm glad the app exists as it is my primary source of NPR. However  the app often takes a few minutes to buffer before playing.

Best standard cam app replacement So far the most versatile camera app you can get for android. How ever not all functions (like adjusting the bitrate and framerate of the videos you wanna record) actually work on every device but are locked due to the video encoder hardware soldered onto the board of your device and cannot be changed.

Sorry  the new graphics have ruined the point to move controls and the game just doesn't flow anymore. Too many times I move to a position I didn't intend.

Wish it had bold  italic and underline buttons. Also wish it had a button to create the cloze brackets instead of manually having to type them. The apple version does both of these things.

Fun and Challenging A great game which I recommend to anyone looking for a challenge. I've easily spent 30+ hours of my life playing so far and still haven't beaten it! But I still come back since its actually fun  brutal and (mostly) fair. Luck sometimes play a major part however  but thats only because of the nature of random generation and rougelike games. Other than that  its a great game which other free games on the app store should strive to be like.,1,0,0,1,40982
Hard to complain about a free app  and it is pretty cool  love being able to shoot RAW. One issue I'm having consistently is that I'll set the focus and everything will look tack sharp on the screen  but when I hit the shutter button  it will refocus and get blurry before capturing. This happens about 50% of the time  and so I can't really rely on it as my go-to camera app. If this issue could be fixed  I would flip it back to being my launch screen choice.,1,1,0,1,169958
This goes to the heart of Linux. If you HAVE root you can add commands with symbolic links to busybox or toolbox. Simply make a symbolic link the busybox or toolbox binary and give it the name of the command you want to add. If you do not have root you can type busybox command name [ args ] and if busybox is present and has the command defined you can run it without root provided root is not needed to run the command. The toolbox binary also works this way.,0,0,0,0,19411
I like it but i seem to experience some type of bug or something. When i recieve a text notification  when my phone is set to silent  it constantly turns on and off the screen until i check or dismiss the notification. Is it the texting app i use?

Not what it used to be Unfortunately  this app has become frustratingly difficult to use. It randomly defaults to either portrait or landscape mode (regardless of settings) and whilst in portrait mode will not scan 1D barcodes.

Bad Change About Attachment At Bottom of Email I have been using K-9 mail for many years. Everything was good but the recent change of putting attachment to bottom of email is very disappointed (in the past  there was a button on top of email to see attachment).

Chromecast Connect Done Quickly! Very fast CC connect with one click after opening app instead of 3 or more with CC app. Main screen could feature better design and it needs a Disconnect one click exit too.

Does need an update for the more recent DLC that's been added  and I would love to compare weapons and armor side by side  but to be honest aside from a few smaller things I LOVE this app. It's made getting through MHGen soooo much easier.

Great writing interface  loses my drafts I think Wordpress has am excellent clean interface for writing (better than Google Docs or the native notes app). However  if I edit a draft while offline  or I have poor WiFi connection at the moment I click save  my file is lost. I can't even access the version before editing.

I like the fact it's open source & doesn't want permissions to everything but it doesn't synch to my Contacts so instead of names from my address book I have just the number.

Amazing widget! As others have said this is a MUST coming from iOS for those who are used to having all their notifications automatically display on their lock screen. This is even better than iOS because you can choose what notifications you want and leave out the ones you do not want. EDIT: My only suggestion is to make the ability for more extensions than 10. But it does not keep it from 5 stars. Plus the tiny 4mb RAM usage makes this app almost perfect.,0,0,1,0,8430
Fixed night mode but zooming is a little dysfunctional.. I love the latest update with night mode and thank you so much for fixing the color problem for older versions of android. My one small issue echoes what I've seen others say as far as the zooming not being very smooth or working great. It can take a few attempts to get everything to be the right size.

Good  but challenging game This is a very well designed game  and fun to play. The randomized dungeons and different classes keep things fresh. My only problem is that many playthroughs can be cut short by the difficulty. It's very luck-based and random  so there's really no telling how and when you'll go down. However  I'm excited to see that there are many different versions of this game  so hopefully I can find something more befitting to my skill level.,1,1,0,1,42450
LaVern Dueck I love this app. The problems started after the last two upgrades. Now when you open an email and try to enlarge it  it just makes it larger than the screen width. It used to re adjust and keep the email screen width and made it longer. Is there a setting for this or is there a program error? July 13 2016. This app has quit functioning properly as of today.

If your looking for a lockscreen this app is incomplete. In fact  it notes the lockscreen feature is still in beta testing so really this app is not doing its 1 job. Example: phone unlocks automatically without swiping and can be done by just a button. Sometimes even auto unlocks when a notification comes up. For the most part this app looks promising as it's clean and minimal. However it's like a video-game you buy which needs constant DLC to make it work.,1,0,0,1,29129
Pretty good app  but there are some missing features. Also  open source is heavily touted but the repository seems pretty dead and locked down. It would be pretty easy to add some theme options for dark mode. And group chats need to notify which members have read the message. The app also uses the iPhone emoji font  so it would be great to be able to switch emoji fonts. Sticker search with words (in addition to the emoji search) would be very nice as well.,1,0,0,1,144195
The app itself is just great. But every now and then it shows in my contact list people I have long deleted from my contact list.

Great RSA Replacement for 4.4.4 OS I tried to get the RSA native client working but it wouldn't import from either QR code or URL.

Great idea but as crazy as this sounds this app caused my WiFi connection on my Nexus 5x running Android 7.1.1 to become sluggish and sometimes unresponsive.

Great app! One problem... This is an awesome app! Just as good as the Facebook app without all the ridiculous permissions. (And you can use messaging in it!!!)

Great app  one problem Love the app  so nice to be able to get nyt crosswords on android.

Great! Very nice app. Further improvements  it would be great if: - We could properly visually navigate the tree of topics and videos.

Great app  terrible UI  inconsistent results. This app is a great STARTING POINT to increased battery life... But nearly every feature is a crap-shoot if it reports correctly (yes stats while charging is disabled). The users is left to interpret nearly every piece of data via XDA or Google  and about 50% of the time the app helped  and other times it leads you in circles  and results that are impossible to EFFECTIVELY narrow down unless rooted (non-KitKat),1,0,1,1,26612
Work/support Slightly confusing on how to do the bios file when you start. But afterwards pretty simple. If you could fix the issue of everytime something goes out of the app (example phone call) even if you ignore or whatever the app resets.

Restoring issues When restoring  the app automatically attempts to restore all data  regardless if it has already been successfully restored. For someone with a lot of SMS to transfer from an old phone  this took more than twelve hours. I don't believe it restored all my messages so I need to try again  but can't wait that long every time.

Great email app- been using it for ages. Two minor issues I have: one  I'm *constantly* accidentally dragging the scrollbar in the messages list. I don't have this issue in other apps so it seems the behavior could be better.

Not bad  make it more convenient to edit the look.

Excellent Using it with Google drive together with passwdsafe sync. Has been reliable in maintaining my passwords between all my devices which are connected to GD. I hope the developer does not abandon this. It does the job for my needs. (Edit) I notice several instances of the same password file in the menu in Google Drive but not existing in the actual GD. I assume these are old sync files. There should be an option to delete old Passwdsafe sync files.,1,0,0,1,132293

Good and Bad I have thousands of books  and this app is a great way to keep track of them all.

Fantastic If you are looking for an app to transform your Android into a proper Linux system  look no further. Termux seamlessly integrates a self-contained Debian-like environment with the rest of your device's directory tree  letting you use familiar tools to work with your Android system. It combines the best qualities of a plain Android terminal emulator with a full sandboxed system like GNURoot Debian. An absolute must-have for Linux power users.,0,0,1,1,66571

I don't understand why Android doesn't have a native app to accomplish what this great app does. My LG G4 was hot all the time since I upgraded to Marshmallow and I didn't know why.

Was great  but no new updates I loved and used DashClock until I got a new phone with Lollipop. Now  the extensions are no longer collapsible  the widget only comes in giant 4x3  and there's no longer lock screen support (which  admittedly  is a Lollipop problem).

Amazing piece of software! I do  however  wish there was an option to keep the screen awake. The wakelock option in the notification shade seems to only stop the app from being closed/slept by Android  rather than it being a screen wakelock. I've been able to work around this by making a tasker task to detect when Termux is open then adjusting the screen timeout accordingly  but it's a bit hit-or-miss. Something built in would probably work better.,1,0,0,0,66868
Difficult and unintuitive First of all  this should not even be a separate app but should be built in the default Numix Icon Pack app. Moreover  when selecting apps with missing apps  it should automatically show the apps which do not have icons. Rather it gives a list of all the apps installed on the phone leading to the user to remember the apps without icons and then select from the list. It's time consuming and unintuitive. Improvements needed.,1,0,1,0,17375
Probably the best such app on the store and  here I speak with complete certainty  my favorite app. Though  there is one problem. I can't access books on my SD card. I don't know why. I just changed my card and moved all the books from my old card to the new one. I know the books are there because when i move them from the card to the phone I can access them  but when I put them back in the card I just can't access them.

Goodbye K9 Sad to uninstall K9 as I have used it for years. I like its visual approach among other things. But its become buggy/unstable and now I am faced with syncing disabled and no way to fix it.

Great app  needs some help on Kit Kat My original comments below are still true  but since Kit Kat hit my phone  I can no longer pause audio using headset controls and this app. Not sure if it's KK or the LG G2  but when I saw another user posting about it here  I figured I'd chime in.

I have been listening to podcasts since before they were called podcasts; on everything from Palm Pilots  iPhones  a Blackberry  Windows Phones  and now Android.

Great App  New Messages Bug Though.. Hey guys  I love this app and everything it represents  although Facebook has recently tried to pull a fast one on you guys by updating their mobile browser messages platform. It causes tinfoil to crash whenever you go to the messages menu.

Still a beta and quite buggy  but beautiful. I really like Timber. It's beautiful  customisable  uses both dark and light status bar icons if your ROM supports it (Xiaomi & Huawei/Honor users (on EMUI 4) will be happy!)

It's great if you plan to never use another phone again. If you do  the option to transfer your authenticator settings to your new device is not there.

After months of beating my head against a wall with storage issues on my Samsung s6  I finally was able to solve them with this app within a few minutes. Android/Samsung take note.

For a free  no-ad app  this is an excellent chess GUI. Pre-installed SF7 is a nice bonus. Wishlist: 1) 2 engine instances at the same time. Either for computer vs player (one instance for computer and the other instance for analysis  so that hash table is not shared)  or for tournaments (two different engines) 2) names for openings 3) sub sec time increments (for example 100ms  250ms  500ms) 4) multi PV analysis 5) hash table occupancy indicator,1,0,0,1,100886
Doesn't work I use to really like this app. But now it sucks a** I will never use this app again. I would click on something to download and it wouldn't even show up in the transfers.

Really useful  well designed app for tracking daily habits. I've been using this app for a while now  and I'm very happy with it. It‚Äôs got lots of features for creating and organizing recurring habits/tasks  but is still simple to use. My favorite feature is the widget to add an item to the desktop  so it's easy to see and check off. One trick I found: insert an emoji as part of the item name for an extra visual identifier. Highly recommended.,1,0,0,1,284622
Practically the best there is Loving the pure black night mode theme. Multiple occurrences and reminders per day are needed  though  and so are widgets for all habits  not just individual ones. It'd be nice if more days could be squeezed into portrait mode  too. Adding daily quotes like in Rewire (and other apps) would also be great. Most importantly  keep up the great work!

Really good player This one plays my mod files flawlessly.

Good but needs improvement in daydream mode Great lock screen app but lacking in daydream mode. When the phone is in landscape  it cuts off the time with certain animations.

Awesome game. You need to worry about health  hunger  equipment degradation  traps  magic. No way to grind and finish the game  you stop gaining exp and equipment if monsters are too low lvl. And you get all sorts of fun nonsense. E.g. when you step on a trap and start burning  run around and continue burning because you are running on grass  try some random azure potion and burn to death because it turns out to be a potion of liquid flame XD,0,0,1,0,43088
Good The controls are odd  but at least I get to use the few mods I have made on the go. Note to the 12 year olds who keep complaining: The difference between this and mine craft is that this is easier to make mods for  and this game is free and open source  meaning you can look at  modify  and redistribute it freely. I was made with those features in mind  NOT being a 100 percent minecraft clone. That's why it has different crafting recipes.,1,0,0,1,133888

Robust app I've been using this app since 2012 and was one of the first apps I installed when I got this new phone. However has been a bit disappointing recently. Minimising stopped back up.

I use it mostly to report graffiti  flyposting  flytipping  and missed bin collections in my local area - I use FillThatHole to report potholes and road defects.,0,1,0,1,72547

I'm loving it A great mobile linux CLI on the go. Almost all basic packages are available. Very good use of gesture zooming  copy paste and much more features. Keeps surprising me even today  after using over six months. Some old compiler packages like gfortran needs to be added to the repo  however. It is still a pain in the neck to build packages from source as the file structures seem somewhat different (especially in unrooted devices).,1,0,0,1,66366

Clean Logical Interface with No Ads! I have previously been a BeyondPod and Podcast Addict User and while they're both good  they can also both be heavy & clunky to navigate.

Great app  responsive developer Up until I updated my Nexus 6p to Android6 7  this app was perfect. Since then  it is the single largest battery consumer. As an example  overnight it drained 30% of the battery simply being resident in memory. On the other hand  it doesn't drain any faster while in use  so you just need to remember to force stop the app. .... As of the 11/29/16 update  not enabling dlna does appear to fix the battery issue.,0,1,0,1,173598
Wonderful! Imagine an instantant download! This is this app. Being so small  you can ensure there is nothing but the flashlight  especially when it's open source. Also  one can use the code of this app to build other ones more complex for different needs  since it's more of a library than an app. It is very simple and doesn't complicate your mind with useless features and complex UIs.

Great little App. I use it as a coach to keep score for our Futsal training.

Not even the network speed. Internet comes to complete halt. It happens more often now. I can't press the BROWSE after it is connected and yes  the Tor icon does turn green.,0,1,0,1,89405
Issues. I'll start off saying this app is awesome. I can stream so many files from my PC to my phone and this is fantastic. But my issues are this. The app will not exit and gives errors and force closes when trying too. It seems to not be shuffling my entire library but choosing a certain amount of songs to shuffle instead.

Sort it out The recent update has rendered my phone to constant error pop up messages which I do not appreciate. So I uninstalled this service because clearly the new update is not compatible with my device (samsung note 2) therefore my rating will remain 1 until you fix this so it can be compatible with my device again. I even reset my phone to factory settings thinking my phone is the problem only just to find out its the damp app!!?!,0,1,1,0,187399
I'm a heavy 'audiobook listener' - and my ageing Sandisk Sansa Clip was a very good audiobook listening device. However  since the really good & small MP3 players aren't being made anymore (or the newer line of Sansa players aren't as good anymore)  I was looking for an audiobook player app for my smartphone. And thanks to Material Audiobook Player  I found it. It's good  no-nonsense  and perfectly sufficient for my needs. Thanks  Paul!,0,0,0,1,157674
This app is not the problem. ATTENTION EVERYONE: You need this app so your Android device can function properly. This is a factory installed application and one of the key building blocks that make up what the Android OS is. You need to allow everything so this app can carry out its function. If not  then it can not perform the necessary commands to allow your apps to run efficiently and your device's battery  performance  etc. suffers.,0,1,0,0,189941
Superb App Beautiful in its straight forward purpose and user friendly interface. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star app for me is the lack of a single feature. ... I'd like it to be possible to parent/nest habits. This would allow greater organization for a long list of habits and make broad habits like improving productivity or fitness less binary. Each nested habit could be a percentage towards competition of the parent.,1,0,1,1,283148

Great app Easy to understand  great info to have when tweaking your system and finding rouge processes. When your phone is getting hot in your pocket for no reason.

AnkiDroid does not support .anki Tried to import .anki files  didn't work  kind of dumb when your apps name is AnkiDroid  no? Only .akpg is allowed.

Guys the previous person tried to explain this to you but it seems no one really listened. Google operates everything on your phone from the Playstore to YouTube. Google has a big successful database and Android is linked with it. Unless you'd rather not have a phone do not disable this app. This is why it takes up so much room.

The emulator seems to operate smoothly. However  I take issue with the clumsy  counter-intuitive controls. For example  I can't just activate a menu item or in-game object by directly clicking on it via the touchscreen. Instead  I have to drag a cursor to highlight the item and then touch the screen to activate it. This is especially difficult when one needs to use the scroll buttons to select game paths within the emulator's interface.,0,1,1,0,174254

Very useful Very useful for reading documents on a Kobo ereader. Easy to use. The integration with the Android share system is great. Better than picking the file from within the app in my opinion  though it's good to have both available.

Did love it. Now disappointed in it. This was the very best Chinese checkers game I had found on Google Play Store. The AI is strong but not totally unbeatable in the short jump mode.

"Fun  yet frustrating No adds. A great """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""pick up and play"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" game that feels like you pick it up and play it fresh each play session. The potions and scrolls shuffle with each new game and it's a rogue-like... so there's perma-death.

This application works as expected. There is some issues with certain midi files with improperly programmed sheet music that causes tempo to be out of range of the this app. This is not the fault of the developer. I like how it scrolls through the notes on the sheet music and also like how the virtual keyboard shows you which keys to press. Very handy little app. Kudos to the developer for making this app and it really is ad-free!!,0,1,0,1,14819
In Awe This is by far the best app I've ever encountered. 1 hour ago I thought I love Winamp  but there's got to be something better out there. Searched Google...found Clementine...saw the word remote...sounded a bit too good to be true...installed the program on my desktop...tinkered with it a bit...playlists and all that...got the app...1 min config...ended up with a remote controller for my music...in awe. Thanks for the app. :),0,0,0,1,66994
Please can you fix white led problem. I used to be able to set it so that my notification led would blink purple. I had to turn it off recently and how I've turned it back on it will only blink blue if set to default or white if set to any other colour.

It just works. Works with lots of other services other than Google that require 2 factor verification like Snapchat. And I also heard there is a new material design  dark theme mode and in app scanner!. I'd wish to have Cloud/Backup in a case where you can't access your codes like Authy does. Maybe integrate with Google Drive. Be able to access it anywhere like the web. And if possible push notifications when someone is logging in.,1,0,1,1,280102
Simply the best messaging app It is simply the best. It is light  has many useful features  doesn't burden the phone with huge app memory. Love the flexibility of groups and channels. Just a suggestion  can you add the feature to switch back to the group/channel chat window when we access the saved chat in the 'cloud'? This feature was working in the previous version  but now it isn't working. Thank you so much for making this app.,1,0,0,1,143088
Loved app til I got new phone. On my old phone I kept backing up my books. When I got a new phone and tried to import them the app says they're not there but when I look at my sd card they are. Plus rotating images worked until I ask not to show me the pop up any more. Now it won't rotate. I have over 1600 books and now because of the import issue I have scan them all over again. It's a pain to have to redo everything from scratch.,0,1,0,1,158874
I love this game I started playing the original Pixel Dungeon almost 3 years ago and last year I found this version and I've fallen in love with both. If I could make a small suggestion  make a game that focuses on the city above the dungeons. I know that would probably be a huge undertaking and take a lot of time to make  but I feel like fans would really enjoy it. Just my two cents though  so it's whatever. Great game though. 5/5,1,0,1,1,172583
Simple to use  works perfectly Only missing a star because scrubbing through tracks can be fiddly to stop at the right place  especially in longer files. I've seen other playback interfaces where the further you move your finger from the timeline (once you've touched it) the less time the marker moves in relation to your finger's movement.

Was wayyyy better before This new look overhaul is horrible. All white keyboard and background makes this app start to drain battery very quickly. Not to mention the assault on the eyes (for a moment I thought this was a flashlight app).

Awesome app with a few minor bugs Great interface! Easy to use and very useful information. There are a few bugs though. It crashes when i try to click a hunting horn to see its details.

Supergroup Admin job is very tough No clear history option is available to Supergroup admins . At least Select all option should be given while making selection for deletion/forwarding.

Better than the stock Android app. A masterfully coded  efficient piece of software. Works great  plays all file formats I throw at it (FLAC  MP3  ogg  ect.) and stores playlists by their file path so I don't have to remake my playlists when I delete my music folders and add new songs. Incredibly efficient  has tons of features  loads almost instantly  and the UI is great. IT uses vector images  so the app is incredibly small  too!,1,0,0,1,96328

Difficult Navigation I have multiple ROMs downloaded  but for some reason the app only shows one  and there is no way in the app to look for my other games. There is also no way to skip frame rate  turn off sound  etc.  all there is when in a game is the touch button  the normal DS buttons  and an icon in the lower right of my screen that only freezes the game.

The Best Messenger App Compared to the other big names in messaging  this multifaceted contender is leaps-and-bounds better in terms of usability  features  and security.

Really great  except when you choose to have a habit repeat a specific number of days (e.g 2 times per 7 days) it doesn't seem to calculate the streak for it correctly. With that setting if I tick on Monday and Sunday it says two streaks of 1  Monday and Saturday says a streak of 2 and 1  and Monday and Tuesday a streak of 7  when in all of those cases it should be 7 because it's two out of 7 days.

You really can't advertise a focus on speed because it takes forever to send messages even on high speed internet. I have 100 mbs down and it can take up to 5 minutes to send. It's infuriating.

Good as daily. Bad for occasional. I love this app. I use it to schedule my sms backup daily. Perfect for that.

Good quality audio  but streaming stations can present challenges Though every time you get a phone call or interrupt the apps playback  the feed (at least for broadcast streaming) is cut off.

Simply WOW I've tested almost all the related apps and this one is by far the greatest. Love the in depth settings and the ways in which I can customize the widget. The only thing that I'm missing is having the date for each task on the right side of the title and not below (widget). It would look so much better. On a galaxy s6 the font for the date is very small on the widget  even at maximum size and it's very tiring to the eyes,0,0,0,1,98455

It's OK Great for devices with very little RAM. Crashes regularly. I would love for the app to go back to the homepage after the last tab is closed instead of the entire app quitting.

Wear support less than hoped First of all  I've been on Muzei already. I was excited to get the wear device I just bought integrated with my phone's wallpaper  but couldn't find it anywhere. Reinstalling the app solved that problem  but there's still no customization - the settings on the blur  gray  etc don't carry over  and there's no battery meter or control of the ambient mode (which is just the time in the top right corner).,1,1,1,0,30849
It's broken The app doesn't work properly anymore: once started  to stop becomes a problem; I have to force stop it.

Also the new UI just isn't right...,1,1,1,0,88552
I like how you can set up habits and how it lets you track them. However the most important component  the reminders  are what lets this app down. They disappear after a while  which means that if you are not looking at the phone around the time you are supposed to do something  the reminder won't be there anymore and you don't do what you needed to do because you forget. Reminders should only disappear when dismissed or snoozed.,1,0,0,1,284619
Easy to use  few permissions. Often crashes. Does most file management tasks  (including on external SD card)  with small footprint and minimal permissions.

I use Kodi for my 32inch LED TV to which I connect my laptop through an HDMI and Kodi along with this app reduces the cost of buying those HDMI streaming devices like Chromecast  Teewe  etc. And this remote app does give an awesome feeling of the so called wireless thing.,1,0,0,1,49465
Works wonders  but the interface is interesting This app is absolutely golden as far as conserving battery life goes. It's on the must-have list of anyone who wishes to get an extra days' use out of their phone.

Good simple app !

Great app. Very fast. Good for group chats as well as personal chats. The best thing about telegram is that the files are not stored in the phones memory but on the cloud which makes it thousand times better than other apps coz you dont have to constantly delete files from your phones memory.

What happened? UPDATE. Latest android update fixed this problem. So back to 5 stars. :-) I've used this app for years and loved it.

Well  some support would be nice... It does exactly what it says on the tin. It's pretty much idiot-proof. So far  so good. And then you look over at iOS. This app was last updated in 2013. The iOS app was updated earlier this year  has a material design icon  and would fit far better into the rest of the UI on a device running 5.0 or up. Kinda sad that Google are better at supporting their own apps when on a rival platform.,1,0,0,1,281471
Satisfies my fix  but leaves plenty to be desired It's good that it draws several crosswords but I feel that there are problems that would be pretty easy to fix. Specifically  the one I get angriest about is that you can't put numbers in the puzzle  even if you change the keyboard. In the past couple weeks  there have been three puzzles I couldn't finish because of that  and it seems like it should be an easy problem to fix.,1,1,0,1,120008
I have been using this app for the last few years  and it's a great one. The scaled down interface is wonderful!

An excellent lightweight clipboard manager which uses minimal system resources.

Light weight  functional and stable The Android default email app is v boring n dull. I use K-9 for my two Outlook  one Yahoo and one own domain accounts. My two Gmail accounts are handled by default Gmail app. Though I thought it was slow in push notifications  but that seems to be working ok now. Everything I want from an email app works flawlessly in K-9. It's lightweight and superior in overall performance. Thumbs up!,0,0,0,0,278284
Was higher rating Was a better app but latest updates caused me to be less excited. As many have said  a simple fat finger or typing error before a word is finished shouldn't be counted against me. If I correct the mistyped letter before moving on  that should not add to error count. Some puzzles have answer boxes shortened. Clearly a mistake in conversion. The author has clearly stopped paying close attention to the app.,1,1,1,0,119918

Does what it says Works great. It'd be nice if the access point list would be more compact. Only 5 or so can be fit on the screen at one time. In dense areas with large number of APs fitting 15-20 on the screen at once would be nice.

Does not support analog remapping. Hoped to switch face buttons to stick for camera control but all directs give the same mapping command. Pretty disappointing. Pretty big oversight.

The only issue I have is a huge turn-off for me: the background noise. I have sensory issues  and that background noise grates at me.

I only want my most used apps to be displayed and my weight bias is set to 'Time spent in app'. However it displays a mixture of apps that I have used recently as well as apps that I have used the most. Is there a way to have only my most used apps shown?,0,1,0,1,9574
Nice and simple! Not loaded with useless features. I really love this app its exactlly what I need. Except for one thing you can backup you your clipboard but there has to be a better way to sync it with all your devices. Maybe some type of cloud sync. Backing it up and restoring can be very tedious especially when you use the clipboard as much as I do. Still great job. I'll give 4 stars when sync issue is improved.,1,1,1,1,100136
Great replacement for Microsoft money I have used Microsoft money version 1.0 since it's release in 1991. It only works in a DOS emulator in Windows 7. It is now time to get to the present. This app does it and imported all my data. Thanks. Sorry  had to drop down to 4 rating. It needs to have account balance display beside every transaction so I can verify my future uncleared balance _ unless I'm missing something.,0,0,1,1,47361
Sound Feedback I love this version. I'm just wondering  maybe it's just me  if the sound feedback couldn't be more subtle? I'm not a great fan of the sounds  but as  for some reason  my vibrating feedback seams to have a mind of it's own  (or maybe it's my phone)  I have to use the sound feedback  and it irritates me very quickly. As I said  maybe it's just me. But either than that  talk back is of great help to me.,1,0,1,1,77131

Great Dev Support Dev answered in two hours of me putting a review. Great design  and hopefully bug will be fixed in the update. This app broke my phone. And then fixed it in return. I love this app like the universe's stars. It (I) broke settings with it. But I uninstalled them and it got fixed. A huge thanks. By the way app extracting works after allowing the storage permission. I'll tell the Dev more on Hangouts.,1,1,1,1,111437
Thank you Daniel Finally a developer that understands the frustrations of Facebook and their inconspicuous ways of integrating into your phone and personal space.

The app is speedy and stable from what I could tell. Thanks!,1,0,1,0,20367
I could not see where Open Camera is significantly better than the other camera apps I have installed (the stock one  CameraNextMod  Google Camera  etc. plus those from photo editing apps)  but neither could I see anything noticeably inferior with it.

Ffff Loved this app when I first got it  after having it for a while though  I had problems with corrupt files downloading when I didn't even select them from the app. I had to delete up to 400 broken files 4 different times before I finally had to delete the app. Not sure what happened but I didn't like the idea of stuff being downloaded when I wasn't aware of it  especially almost 1500 junk files that didn't work.,0,1,0,1,122815

Really fun and completely Awesome! This is an excellent game and the recent updates are great! It's really fun and it still is fun after a few re-runs sadly their ain't too many floors but it's still fun and difficult.

Overall addictive First things first: if you find a way to conserve food  take it. Sometimes you will be spending a long time on a floor and starving is a common death.

There's a massive level of customization in playstyle.,0,0,1,0,41724
Amazing app for free No ads? Daily puzzles (with the option to import paid ones too)? For free? Yeah  there are a couple of small bugs on my Galaxy S4--once I use the keyboard  I can't skip words until I tap the crossword again--but given that it's not pestering me every 5 minutes about Candy Crush  I'm okay with that. So if it works on your phone  this is the best crossword app of all. And it's free  so try it out.,0,1,0,0,120931
Great app! I've read other people's comments having issues with the new update. They're having trouble finding the new game option  among other things. Well those people are just plain stupid.

False security  watch out for retained thumbnails No fault of the app developer  but I found that Android had accumulated 3GB worth of reduced res thumbnails on my system under DCIM/.thumbnails.

A very simple app that does exactly what you need it to do with no extra frills. One tap on the app turns the light on. Another tap on the screen turns the light off.

If Everyone would use a little common sense and their eyes and look you'd see the Earth is flat. The Sun and Moon wasn't created until the fourth day; so how could the Earth orbit the Sun?

Good  but Needs more flexibility with regard to grouping periods A good app that does what it says on the tin. As setting up scheduled payments relies on the Grouping Periods to set the payment frequency  the fixed choice of period means that certain transactions cannot be scheduled such as those for every 30 days  fortnightly  and quarterly. It would be great to set custom payment frequencies to cover such cases.,0,0,0,1,47359

Dose exactly what I needed it to. I have used a program called WinDIR on windows to scan my files and make a visual representation of the files and folders within my drive based on file size and type.

Great game Been playing for a while now. Seen a couple updates. This is a grind game. Takes time. Well built with divergent story lines. If you want a game that is a time investment  this is it.

Great design but a few bugs I'm running into the same bugs as derek chan where my anime list shows instead of the manga list. Seems to consistently happen if I view an anime or manga's details by tapping on it in my list and then go back to my list.

I found this app by searching for photosphere since my new phone isn't a nexus model this time and I miss having that feature. Looks like nobody has it but the reason I'm giving 3 stars is I took a close up picture with my phone's default app and this app. The default app takes the picture quicker and the image is much cleaner and when zooming in on the images is far clearer and higher quality.

Has a lot of potential but still some bugs  the most noticeable for me is there are times when it refuses to auto-focus my Nexus 6. Of course when this happens I miss the moment for the photo I want.

There's no video or voice chat yet  but once they're implemented rest assured there will be no good reason to choose Skype over Telegram.,0,0,0,1,143477

I use keepassX so it is great to have this available  but there are some serious problems.

It works  you can download music. Very hit or miss though and it seems to me that whenever I look for current or widely popular content  is when it misses most. Then when it recommends downloading the plus version of the app  it's about getting paid.

Absolutely brilliant! Provides so much control over every apps' internet access  whether wifi or mobile. One click and the phone is locked down. Now no app can access the Internet - but exceptions can be made for your favorite apps if you choose. Such a polished and intuitive interface makes it a joy to use.

Great app except 1 thing This app is great and creates such an awesome look with either random art or my own gallery. Only thing I'm having trouble with is the timing. I set it to every 24 hours to change my background and yet it changes at least a few times a day. Changed it to every 3 days and it changes every 1 day or less. Not sure why it's changing more often than I set it. Otherwise I love this app.,0,0,0,1,30927
Works  but the interface... On the plus side it works more or less without a STUN server where other clients fail (even with a STUN server). On the negative side the interface is taken straight from Android 1.5  it doesn't give the option to select between lines (haven't found any at least)  doesn't allow more than 2 lines)  ...

Useful  could use UI improvements Very helpful for me (I never remember if I've already read a book until I'm halfway through it again...)

Nice I like the new interface. One usability suggestion though. When searching for an entry  do live search/update/filtering after each keypress instead of requiring to finish the search input with a return key and then do the search.

Does what it's supposed to do ? ? but there's room for improvement. What I'd love to see is the recognition of even more mime types (e.g. the Google Authenticator protocol isn't recognised). Also reading QR-codes from a bitmap would be a great addition because sometimes people share those with you and obviously you cannot scan them using the camera when the screen is part of the same device :-) Thanks!,0,0,0,1,92527
Set up still a mess! 2017 UPDATE (original review 2013) - For approx' 5 years I've used K9 as my main email client. The setup is still a problem  complete hit or miss. Hours are spent on forums trying to find the correct settings for accounts to work correctly. The auto settings used by the app simply do not access accounts (Yahoo!) correctly. The best app ONCE SETUP  but setup really makes this awful.,0,1,0,0,278949
Simple Last.fm works better than Last.fm app. Nevertheless  I had a major problem that pretty much any available scrobbling app wouldn't work offline including Simple last.fm. I've tried everything  but what solved the issue for me was going into the settings of my phone and allowing the simple last.fm app to run even when I turn off (lock) the screen. Worked like a charm.

Simple  practical  motivating interface! One of the only apps that do not penalize for breaking streaks.

New update no functionality I used to love this app because it allowed me to save a playlist of stories even if they got removed. Ever since the update the Playlist feature just doesn't work at all once the app is closed and in every single podcast about 5 minutes in it rewinds about 5 seconds like some kind of glitch.

This a very easy to use app. I have had no problems using it and haven't noticed any glitches or bugs. It's a great alternative to Google's email client that comes with Android  for those of you who are concerned about privacy online. I love the fact that it's open source but I don't know if the code has been thoroughly audited. Having said that I still highly recommend over a proprietary email client.,0,1,0,1,279247

Good idea but missing some features When it works it works very good but when it doesn't it's frustrating.

It works well  has Bitmoji integration  fun to use  but has some annoying deviations from Android coding standards  such as using the system sounds channel instead of the notifications sounds channel for notification sounds  which doesn't improve the user experience and in fact interferes with it.

Not worth the frustration. This game is infuriatingly hard  to the point where it's not even fun anymore. The graphics are nice and gameplay is smooth  which is the only reason this is getting two stars from me. It needs a save or checkpoint system really badly. Oh  and if you play at night - which I usually do - the game is EVEN HARDER. The lowest I was able to get is 4  so you be the judge of that.,0,0,1,1,41284
As per Sion Kim  can't get it to show up on the locked black screen (am using A5.1)  which is the whole point of it......I would NO star if i could!

Setting your location manually fixes the out-of-sync charts. :) Network based auto location settings used to work like a charm before  but now fail to do this  and unfortunately the app doesn't warn/prompt you either.

The gyro feature has made moving around the AR interface absolutely beautiful.,1,1,1,1,166158
Crashes consistantly Love the app and how lightweight it runs  been using it for almost a year now  but in the last week it's started crashing every time I use it.

Good app  could use much needed improvements Good app  does the job. Here are a few improvementd this app desperately needs: (samsung GS4) Use an other time selection for the rotation timer  this one doesnt go above 9h  and is badly designed.

This app is okay  but as others have already stated  there is a bug whereby it doesn't remember the location of my keepass database (Google drive).

Best of the rest! I've been using FBReader for almost 2 years now and it never once let me down. But there is a recent hiccup on my new phone.

Almost perfect I love this text app. however a few things I'd like to see fixed. the predictive text is quite good but could do a better job of memorizing how u type so I wouldn't have to keep flicking up to have the right word. also could integrate various languages for people like me who talk in spanglish. those are two key things that would simplify the experience.

Weird Search Function This app has made my book collection organised for the first time. The only big issue I have with it is that it is difficult to add books I have or have read but not with me. The Internet search function when searching under author or title only brings up one book and that does not change after the book has been added. Sometimes the book found is completely not relevant.,0,1,0,0,158853

Meh Not bad I guess  except for they base everything on the forked-tongue NASA serpent lies that the Earth is a ball.

So far so good Tested on Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 and running fine with Crazy Taxi 2. Controller support is a must though and hopefully you'll implement it in a future update. I'd even pay for it as it's such a good emulator. Keep up the good work. It's working on Smart Ultra 6 too. If it doesn't work on your device (Intel processor maybe?) just download a version from the website as that may work.,1,0,0,1,3624
On Nexus 5 I've been using this as my main alarm for 5 years now on various phones and never had an issue with it. There was a warning about malware last time I downloaded but I've checked the forums and the code and there is no issue. This app works great and has never let me down.

Pretty good  great for midi notation  but still lacking in some areas...

Nearly Perfect- Best Mobile Browser Available So far I am in love with this browser. It's quick  it's responsive  it's elegant and simple in its design.

No-nonsense  great app. Works on all of my devices. For me  this application helped in my old android phones where there weren't any updates or were low on internal memory.

Simple and clean but needs some polish It is a nice and fast app but the UI needs some improvements. One problem I have with it is that it truncates the names of all files and folders so if you want to know the name of a file you need to long press select it and then go to menu properties  also on selecting files I wish it showed a bar with quick shortcuts to cut  copy  paste  share etc.,1,1,0,0,70264

I repurchased to see if it was added but 15min refund button wasn't there. Requested a refund. Developer told me no  too bad  use one of the available device frames even if it isn't yours. Very unprofessional.,1,0,0,1,173829
Good idea but... I use sagemath a lot on my computer and I was really happy to see that I could use it when I'm on transport too. However the app is not working at all : for the simplest command (like 'print 3') then it doesn't stop loading and nothing is executed.

Absolute garbage software as it caused major compatibility issues with my Play Store client (hosted on a Android 2.5 device)  making it unable to display main apps library or to download anything from the Store.

It's ok First you starve way to fast and the enemies can kill you in a blink of an eye. Second there should be checkpoints if you die then instead of going back to the top you can head right to level 5 or something. Third  can we have some spells and scrolls at the beginning?

Simple This app does exactly what it should and says: it makes changes to your system hosts file  which on any Linux system requires root access. Every negative rating for this app is ridiculous.

I used to love this app  but I recently had to do a factory reset of my phone  and although I've used this app for many years  my data is lost.

I'm amazed what this app can do with a tiny 1.4 MB (the size it occupied on my Nexus 5) what other Apps achieve with many times that size. I'm equally impressed by its accuracy: I compared with a brand name App over five days and found it to be just as accurate. And lest I forget  it's also very frugal in consumption of the battery.

Good for recording purpose  bad for restoring It is useful to have SMS continuously synced to my Gmail so I can read and search them conveniently. However  the backup on Gmail is NOT a faithful representation of the SMS actually on your phone  hence it causes problems when trying to restore (and it's very slow compared to most other apps). Do NOT use this app for backup & restoring.,0,1,0,1,22124
Superb First off let me say that the dev is among the best. Communicates well  works fast and tries his best to please. And that's for a free app. The companies making money should learn from him.

Works pretty well  but it would be great if we could set the increments that the volume changes  rather than it being linear. The minimum volume while you're barely moving is too loud when you're totally stopped  and if you adjust it the other way you can't hear anything until you're at whatever speed equates to 75% of the maximum.

Switched to an older phone  seeing issues now 1GB of RAM (~650 MB of that is usable) has showed me a pretty big issue with this browser -- eventually  other apps will start closing and sooner or later Lightning itself will OOM.

It keeps draining my battery. It started a few days ago. The app will suddenly increase its battery consumption of up to 64%!

Fun I enjoy this game a lot. It is challenging and never the same. If I were to change anything it would just be the layout on the screen. The unplayed blocks could be smaller and slightly closer together so that the board could be placed lower on the screen allowing space for menues to be above the board. Occasionally I open a menu unintentionally. But the game itself is great,1,0,0,1,89713
Google play 4 stars i have always loved my google play. Its super awesome. I love this app so much I wish it could only be for me.

Good but snags After several games it introduces no wins and the touch pad betrays moves to errant moves. Using the Solve feature works well on simple puzzles  but on complex ones becomes confused making box canyon moves from which it cannot remedy.

Now it is user-friendly (: The developer listened listened and fixed a major issue with Android Marshmallow marshmallow devices. Moreover I claimed that the app is deleting older records.

Reasonable  but terrible overlapping and switching between bands and it gives poor advice. Overlapping (text wrapping) on details. The suggestions for channels is massively wrong and in very built up areas suggesting anything other than channel 1  6 and 11 is a bad idea. The interface isn't particularly neat. It has some nice features  but I prefer the other WiFi Analyser app.,1,0,0,1,46872
A nice  little  lightweight file manager. The app has a simple 'no-frills' design  and is ad-free  permission-lite and open source.

UI/UX: The fact that the Toolbar is scrollable in Paste mode makes it very inconvenient to paste files: when you want to paste and the Toolbar is not visible  you have to scroll down to bring it  but quite often the swipe to refresh is triggered instead  so you have to have several tries until the Toolbar manages to catch the scroll event.

No support at all 1. The creators offer abolutely no support whatsoever for this commercial product (the server costs a monthly fee). 2. The Linux server cannot be run as another user than root on Ubuntu 14.04  which effectively makes the installation package a complete fail. A perfect example of how not to create software and how not to be a commercial creator of software.,0,1,0,0,16514
Great emulator. I love that I can play SA2 anywhere at nearly max FPS on my GS5. This emulator is quite impressive. I love the Dreamcast so I greatly appreciate all of the work that was put into this software. It's a bit fiddly to set up as the directory selections are not saved until you re-start the program  but other than that I can't possibly speak enough praise. Thanks,0,0,1,1,3784
The best Subsonic app. Period. Absolutely the best app to pair with your Subsonic. Great features  excellent UI  plenty of widgets  and frequent updates by a very involved Dev. Well worth the cost  so just buy it. My only wish is that the Dev would update the icon to a material design look to compliment Marshmallow. Small gripe though because it's the best SS app available.,1,0,0,1,173338
This app has been extremely useful to me. I initially downloaded it so that I would be able to create a portable catalogue of my library  which would help keep me from buying books I already owned.

Well Done This application performed admirably at its assigned task which is to read barcodes and read them accurately. It manages to read barcodes that other applications do not read correctly.

Impressive While this app is very simple - 4 brush types  set color pallate  no layers  no redo - it does respond to pressure on devices without built-in pressure sensitivity as advertised.

Important note! After installing  make sure you go to Auto Backup Settings and check off: Require Wi-Fi.

Good but could be easier to use and look better Works well and a good  reliable app  but however. Need to hold my phone very still to work. Also need to have barcode item on a surface.

Decent app. Works alright but I get this feeling that it's not completely random like a coin flip should be. I know that you have a 50/50 shot at heads or tails but anyone who has ever actually flipped a coin before knows that it does not always work out 50/50. I feel like this app tries to keep it 50/50 rather then actually make it feel like a real coin flip.,1,0,0,1,110278
Life changer. Love this app. Have been using it for a month. I drive myself to continue with a habit  just so that I can tick the check mark and visibly look at each habit's rising consistency.

Seven Years & Counting... Wordpress is my free app to post my personal blog. For seven years I have been blogging on Wordpress with no complaints. The only drawback is that occasionally the folks over at Wordpress change something that is not broken in the software; consequently; the fix creates a glitch in the app that takes a while for WordPress to correct.,0,0,0,0,84661

Good so far One issue I see is the way it formats messages for Gmail. If a person is in my contacts with an email address  the phone number they texted from is buried in an X-header.

Great tool - thank you Gives me all my Android-possible settings in one go. I regularly photograph documents and products in monochrome and at reduced resolution.

Migration option removed Authenticator used to have a 'migrate to new phone' option  so if you had to change phones  you could easily take all the 2fa accounts to the new one. Piece of cake.

Great app and works fine with icloud account This is my primary task management app and using it in conjunction with Smoothsync. Sync itself works as promised.

Open Camera worked only sporadically  immediately after installation  on my Samsung Galaxy S5 running Marshmallow 6.0.1. Now  the app freezes after every shot and doesn't save the pictures.

On every platform In a Mac user and use PWSafe on that platform because it does exactly what I want for a much lower price. This app is great because it's compatible with the Mac app I use.

Useful but needs work While it does indeed read .ODT and does a good job of it the interface is clunky and obscure.

Great app App is pretty self explanatory and easy to navigate. You can invite all your contacts to join which is a plus. Also their is a secret chat tab which you can lock and won't be accessed by anyone else but you. Only down fall is that none of my contacts have the app and I had to invite them.

Really good  but... This app is always my go-to app for using ssh on the go. It works really well and all the core features I use are there.

Good app  request an additional feature... I wish the daydream mode would allow you to choose dim for night and day. In the day I want the clock brighter than when I'm trying to sleep.

Solid app Other clients don't tend to support qbittorrent to the point some won't have label support. This app works well and is simple to set up. I also like that there's a dark theme.

Very good I much prefer the interface of this to Droidsound-E but the sound appears (to my ears) slightly different than when I play modules on a real Amiga.

Love-hate relationship. This widget is great. Super customisable  has great features and allows me to access everything in one place.

Guys please fix the issue with fire phones  I've seen so many reviews asking you to do that. Apparently this new update has not only left fire phones fucked  but other Android phones also!

Useful but frustrating I downloaded the app to write posts offline and upload them when we had internet connection.

Requires multiple touches I love the choice of puzzles and overall design of the app. I give it 3 stars because I often have tap a box 4-6+ times for the app to switch to that box.

My Condolences This games has stopped updating for while now  so there isn't much for me to critique anymore.

It's pretty good It scans the item quick and gives me a number  but sometimes when I press product search it says nothing matched.

Overall good app though. ??,0,0,1,1,94076

Lockscreen not stable I really think you should make just a lockscreen. This app is something in between a lockscreen and a notification app and it is not stable all the time.

Amazing! If you're a huge book collector like I am this is by far the best way to keep track of your collection.
